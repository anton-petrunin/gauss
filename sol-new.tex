Suppose the complement $\Omega=\spc{X}\backslash Q$ is open.

It follows that $p$ is not a limit point of any sequence $q_n\in Q$.
That is, any limit of a sequence in $Q$ lies in $Q$;
that is, by the definition, $Q$ is closed.

Now suppose $\Omega=\spc{X}\backslash Q$ is not open.
Show that there is a point $p\in \Omega$ and a sequence $q_n\in Q$ such that such that $\dist{p}{q_n}{\spc{X}}\z<\tfrac 1n$ for any $n$.

\parbf{\ref{aex:simple-curve}.}
Let $\alpha$ be a path, connecting $p$ to $q$.

Passing to an arc of $\alpha$ if necessary,
we can assume that $\alpha(t)\ne p,q$ for $t\ne0,1$.

An open set $\Omega$ in $(0,1)$ will be called {}\emph{suitable}
if for any connected component $(a,b)$ of $\Omega$ we have $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$.
Show that the union of nested suitable sets is suitable.
Therefore we can find a maximal suitable set $\hat \Omega$.

Define $\beta(t)=\alpha(a)$ for any $t$ in a connected component $(a,b)\subset\hat \Omega$, and $\beta (t) = \alpha (t) $ for $t$ not in $\hat{\Omega}$.
Note that for any $x\in [0,1]$ the set $\beta^{-1}\{\beta(x)\}$ is connected.

It remains to reparametrize $\beta$ to make it injective.
In order to do that, we need to construct a non-decreasing surjective function $\tau\:[0,1]\z\to[0,1]$ such that 
$\tau(t_1)=\tau(t_2)$ if and only if there is a connected component $(a,b)\subset\hat \Omega$ such that $t_1,t_2\z\in [a,b]$.

The required function $\tau$ can be constructed in a similar way to the so-called {}\emph{devil's staircase} --- learn this construction and modify it.

The simple arc we are looking for is $\beta \circ \sigma$, where $\sigma\:  [0,1]\to [0,1]$ is any right inverse of $\tau$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:L-shape}.}
Denote the union of two half-axis by $L$.

Recall that the function $f$ is smooth; see Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.
Therefore $t\mapsto \alpha(t)=(f(t),f(-t))$ is smooth as well.

Observe that $f(t)\to\infty$ as $t\to \infty$.
Since $f(0)=0$, the intermediate value theorem implies that $f(t)$ takes all nonnegative values for $t\ge 0$.
Use it to show that $L$ is the range of~$\alpha$.

\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}{24 mm}

\end{wrapfigure}

Further, show that the function $f$ is strictly increasing for $t> 0$.
Use this to show that the map $t\mapsto \alpha(t)$ is injective.

Summarizing, we get that $\alpha$ is a smooth parametrization of $L$. 

Now suppose $\beta\:t\mapsto (x(t),y(t))$ is a smooth parametrization of~$L$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $x(0)=y(0)=0$.
Note that $x(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$ therefore $x'(0)=0$.
The same way we get that $y'(0)=0$.
That is, $\beta'(0)=0$;
so $L$ does not admit a smooth regular parametrization.

\parbf{\ref{ex:cycloid}.}
Apply the definitions.
For \ref{SHORT.ex:cycloid:regular} you need to check that $\gamma'_\ell\ne 0$.

For $\ell=0$ the system describes a pair of points $(0,0,\pm1)$, so we can assume that $\ell\ne 0$.

For $\ell\ne 0$,
find the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla h$ for the functions
\begin{align*}
 f(x,y,z)&=x^2+y^2+z^2-1
 \\
 h(x,y,z)&=x^2+\ell\cdot x+y^2

and show that they are linearly dependent only on the $x$-axis.
Conclude that for $\ell\ne\pm 1$ each connected component of the set of solutions is a smooth regular curve.

Show that 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $|\ell|<1$, then the set has two connected components with $z>0$ and $z<0$.
\item if $|\ell|\ge1$, then the set is connected.
\end{itemize}

Note that the linear independence of the gradients provides only a sufficient condition.
Therefore the case $\ell=\pm1$ has to be checked by hand.
In this case a neighborhood of $(\pm1,0,0)$ does not admit a smooth regular parametrization --- try to prove it. 
The case $\ell=1$ is shown on the diagram.

\parit{Remark.}
The case $\ell=\pm1$ is called \index{Viviani's curve}\emph{Viviani's curve}.
It admits the following smooth regular parametrization with a self-intersection:

Suppose that $\gamma_2$ is reparametrization of $\gamma_1$ by $\tau\:[a_1,b_1]\to [a_2,b_2]$;
without loss of generality we may assume that $\tau$ is nondecreasing.
Set $\theta_i=\tau(t_i)$.
Observe that $a_2=\theta_0\z\le\theta_1\le \z\dots\le\theta_k=b_2$ if and only if

Choose a partition $0=t_0<\dots <t_n=1$ of $[0,1]$.
Set $\tau_0=0$ and

for $i>0$.
Show that $(\tau_i)$ is a partition of $[0,1]$;
that is, $0=\tau_0<\tau_1<\dots<\tau_n=1$.

By construction 
\begin{align*}
|\alpha(t_0)&-\alpha(t_1)|+|\alpha(t_1)-\alpha(t_2)|+\dots+|\alpha(t_{n-1})-\alpha(t_n)|=
\\
&=

\end{align*}
Since the partition $(t_i)$ is arbitrary, we get 
\[\length \beta\ge \length \alpha.\]

Note that the partition $(\tau_i)$ is not arbitrary, therefore the inequality might be strict; it might happen if $\beta$ runs back and forth along $\alpha$.

Show that 
\[\length\gamma_k=k\cdot\length \gamma.\]

Now suppose the arc $\gamma$ of the Koch snowflake shown on the diagram is rectifiable; denote its length by $\ell$.
Observe that $\gamma$ can be divided into 4 arcs such that each one is a scaled copy of $\gamma$ with factor $\tfrac13$.
It follows that $\ell=\tfrac43\cdot\ell$.
Evidently $\ell>0$ --- a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:arc-length-helix}.} 
We have to assume that $a\ne 0$ or $b\ne0$;
otherwise we get a constant curve.

Show that the curve has constant velocity $|\gamma'(t)|\equiv \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.

It remains to substitute $s\cdot \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ for $t$.

Choose a closed polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ inscribed in $\beta$.
By \ref{cor:convex=>rectifiable}, we can assume that its length is arbitrary close to the length of $\beta$;
that is, given $\epsilon>0$ 
\[\length (p_1\dots p_n)>\length\beta-\epsilon.\]

Show that we may assume in addition that each point $p_i$ lies on $\alpha$.

Observe that since $\alpha$ is simple, the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ appear on $\alpha$ in the same cyclic order;
that is, the polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ is also inscribed in $\alpha$.
In particular 
\[\length\alpha\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n).\]
It follows that 
\[\length\alpha>\length\beta-\epsilon.\]
for any $\epsilon>0$.
Whence 
\[\length\alpha\ge\length\beta.\]

If $\alpha$ has self-intersections, then the points $p_1,\dots, p_n$ might appear on $\alpha$ in a different order, say $p_{i_1},\dots,p_{i_n}$.
Apply the triangle inequality to show that 
\[\length(p_{i_1}\dots p_{i_n})\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n)\]
and use it to modify the proof above.

\parbf{\ref{ex:convex-croftons}.} 
Denote by $\ell_{\vec u}$ the line segment 
obtained by orthogonal projection of $\gamma$ to the line in the direction ${\vec u}$.
Since $\gamma_{\vec u}$ runs along $\ell_{\vec u}$ back and forth, we get 
\[\length\gamma_{\vec u}\ge 2\cdot\length\ell_{\vec u}.\]
Applying the Crofton formula, we get that 
\[\length\gamma\ge \pi\cdot \overline{\length\ell_{\vec u}}.\]

In the case of equality, the curve $\gamma_{\vec u}$ runs exactly back and forth along $\ell_{\vec u}$ without additional zigzags for almost all (and therefore for all) ${\vec u}$.

Let $K$ be a closed set bounded by $\gamma$.
Observe that the last statement implies that every line may intersect $K$ only along a closed segment or a single point.
It follows that $K$ is convex.

\parbf{\ref{adex:more-croftons}.}
The proof is identical to the proof of the standard Crofton formula.
To find the coefficient it is sufficient to check it on a unit interval.
The latter can be done by integration:
\begin{align*}
\frac1{k_a}&=\frac{1}{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\iint_{\mathbb{S}^2} |x|;
&
\frac1{k_b}&=\frac{1}{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\iint_{\mathbb{S}^2} \sqrt{1-x^2}.

The answers are $k_a=2$ and $k_b=\tfrac4\pi$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:intrinsic-convex}.}
The ``only-if'' part is trivial.
To show the ``if'' part, assume $A$ is not convex;
that is, there are points $x,y\in A$ and a point $z\notin A$ that lies between $x$ and $y$.

Since $A$ is closed, its complement is open.
That is, the ball $B(z,\epsilon)$ does not intersect $A$ for some $\epsilon>0$.

Show that there is $\delta>0$ such that any path of length at most $\dist{x}{y}{\mathbb{R}^3}+\delta$ passes thru $B(z,\epsilon)$.
It follows that $\dist{x}{y}A\ge \dist{x}{y}{\mathbb{R}^3}+\delta$, 
in particular $\dist{x}{y}A\ne \dist{x}{y}{\mathbb{R}^3}$.

The spherical curve shown on the diagram does not have antipodal pairs of points.
However it has three points $x,y,z$ on one of its sides and their antipodal points $-x,-y,-z$ on the other.
Show that this property is sufficient to conclude that the curve does not lie in any hemisphere.

\parbf{\ref{ex:bisection-of-S2}.}
Assume contrary, then by the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) $\gamma$ lies in an open hemisphere.
In particular it cannot divide $\mathbb{S}^2$ into two regions of equal area --- a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:flaw}.}
The very first sentence is wrong --- it is {}\emph{not} sufficient to show that diameter is at most 2.
For example an equilateral triangle with circumradius slightly above $1$ may have diameter (which is defined as the maximal distance between its points) slightly bigger than $\sqrt3$, so it can be made smaller that $2$.

On the other hand, it is easy to modify the proof of the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) to get a correct solution.
That is, (1) choose two points $p$ and $q$ on $\gamma$ that divide it into two arcs of the same length;
(2) set $z$ to be a midpoint of $p$ and $q$,
and (3) show that $\gamma$ lies in the unit disc centered at $z$.

For \ref{SHORT.adex:crofton:crofton}, modify the proof of the original Crofton formula

Assume $\length \gamma<2\cdot\pi$.
By \ref{SHORT.adex:crofton:crofton},
\[\overline{\length \gamma_{\vec u}}<2\cdot\pi.\]
Therefore we can choose ${\vec u}$ so that 
\[\length \gamma_{\vec u}<2\cdot\pi.\]

Observe that $\gamma_{\vec u}$ runs in a semicircle $h$ and therefore $\gamma$ lies in a hemisphere with $h$ as a diameter.

Since $\langle\tan,\tan\rangle=1$, we have $\tan'\perp \tan$.

Since $\gamma(0)=\gamma(\ell)$ and $\gamma'(0)=\gamma'(\ell)$, the right hand side vanishes.


Note that without loss of generality we can assume the curve in \ref{thm:DNA} is described by a loop $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to\mathbb{R}^3$ parametrized by arc-length.
We can also assume that the origin is the center of the ball; that is $|\gamma|\le 1$.
Since $\gamma$ is a smooth closed curve, we have

Therefore $\tgc{\gamma_a}=-2\cdot\pi$ and $\tc\gamma_a=|\tgc{\gamma_a}|=2\cdot\pi$.

\parit{Case $|a|<1$.}
Set $\theta_a=\arcsin a$.
Show that $\tan_a(t)=\gamma'_a/|\gamma'_a|$ starts with the horizontal direction $\tan_a(0)=(1,0)$, turns monotonically to angle $\theta_a$, then monotonically to $-\theta_a$ and then monotonically to back to $\tan_a(2\cdot\pi)=(1,0)$.
It follows that if $|a|>1$, then
$\tgc{\gamma_a}=0$ and $\tc{\gamma_a}=4\cdot\theta_a$.

\parit{Case $a=-1$.}
The velocity $\gamma'_{-1}(t)$ vanishes at $t=0$ and $2\cdot\pi$.
Nevertheless, the curve admits a smooth regular parametrization --- find it.
In this case $\tgc{\gamma_{-1}}=-\pi$ and $\tc{\gamma_{-1}}=\pi$.

\parit{Case $a=1$.}
The velocity $\gamma'_1(t)$ vanishes at $t=\pi$.
At $t=\pi$ the curve has a cusp;
that is, $\gamma_1$ turns exactly back at the time $\pi$.
So $\gamma_1(t)$ has undefined total signed curvature.
The curve is a joint of two smooth arcs with external angle $\pi$, and
the total curvature of each arc is $\tfrac\pi2$, so 
$\tc{\gamma_{1}}=\tfrac\pi2+\pi+\tfrac\pi2=2\cdot\pi$.

So if $\gamma_\ell'(t)=0$, then $\ell\cdot \skur(t)= 1$.

Suppose $|\ell|<\frac{1}{\kur(t)}$ for any $t$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:vertex-support}.}
Apply the spiral lemma (\ref{lem:spiral}).

\parit{Direct solution.} 
We will assume that the curvature does not vanish at $p$, the remaining case is simpler.
We may assume that $\gamma$ is a unit-speed curve and $p=\gamma(0)$.
Further, we may assume that be the center of curvature of $\gamma$ at $p$ is the origin;
in other words, $\kur(0)\cdot\gamma(0)+ \norm(0)=0$.

Since the osculating circle supports $\gamma$ at $p$,
we get that the function $f\:t\mapsto \langle\gamma(t),\gamma(t)\rangle$ has a local minimum or maximum at $0$.

Direct calculations show that 
\begin{align*}
f'
&=\langle\gamma,\gamma\rangle'
=2\cdot\langle\tan,\gamma\rangle,
\\
f''
&=2\cdot\langle\tan,\gamma\rangle'
=2\cdot\langle\tan',\gamma\rangle+2\cdot\langle\tan,\tan\rangle
=2\cdot\kur\cdot\langle\norm,\gamma\rangle+2,

&=2\cdot\kur'\cdot\langle\norm,\gamma\rangle
+2\cdot\kur\cdot\langle\norm',\gamma\rangle+\cancel{2\cdot\kur\cdot\langle\norm,\tan\rangle}.
\end{align*}

Observe that $\norm'(0)\perp\gamma(0)$.
Therefore $f'(0)=0$, $f''(0)=0$, and $f'''(0)\z=-2\cdot\kur'/\kur$.
Since $f$ is a maximum or minimum at $0$, we get that $f'''(0)=0$ and therefore
$\kur'=0$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:support}.} Consider the coordinate system with $p$ as the origin and $x$-axis as the common tangent line to $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
We may assume that $\gamma_i$ are defined in $(-\epsilon,\epsilon)$ for some small $\epsilon>0$,
so that they run almost horizontally to the right.

Given $t\in[0,1]$ consider the curve $\gamma_t$ that is tangent and cooriented to the $x$ axis at  $\gamma_t(0)$ and has signed curvature defined by $\skur_t(s)=(1\z-t)\cdot\skur_0(s)+t\cdot\skur_1(s)$.
It exists by \ref{thm:fund-curves-2D}.

Choose $s\approx 0$.
Consider the curve $\alpha_s\:t\mapsto \gamma_t(s)$.
Show that $\alpha_s$ moves almost vertically up.
Use the fact that $\gamma_t$ moves almost horizontally to the right to show that in a small neighborhood of $p$, the curve $\gamma_1$ lies above $\gamma_0$,
whence the statement follows.

In the latter case we have two choices, either $p_4$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$ and then further order is determined uniquely or $p_2$ lies between $p_3$ and $p_4$.

Denote the set of solutions by $\Sigma_\ell$.

Show that $\nabla_p f=0$ if and only if $p=(0,0,0)$.
Use \ref{prop:implicit-surface} to conclude that if $\ell\ne 0$, then $\Sigma_\ell$ is a union of disjoint smooth regular surfaces.

Show that $\Sigma_\ell$ is connected if and only if $\ell\le 0$.
It follows that if $\ell<0$, then $\Sigma_\ell$ is a smooth regular surface, and if $\ell>0$ --- it is not.

The case $\ell=0$ has to be done by hand --- it does not satisfy the sufficient condition in \ref{prop:implicit-surface}, but that does not solely imply that $\Sigma_0$ is not a smooth surface.

Show that any neighborhood of origin in $\Sigma_0$ cannot be described by a graph in any coordinate system;
so by the definition (Section~\ref{sec:def-smooth-surface}) $\Sigma_0$ is not a smooth surface.

+\left(\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2}-1\right)^2=1.\]
for any $u$ and $v$.

Furthermore, show that the map $(x,y,z)\mapsto (\tfrac{2\cdot x}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\tfrac{2\cdot y}{x^2+y^2+z^2})$
describes the inverse of $s$, which is continuous away from the origin.
In particular, $s$ is an embedding that covers the entire sphere except for the origin.

It remains to show that $s$ is regular; that is, $s_u$ and $s_v$ are linearly independent at all points of the $(u,v)$-plane.

\parbf{\ref{ex:revolution}.}

(It might help to observe that $s_t\perp s_\theta$).

Show that $s$ is a embedding; that is, any $(t_0,\theta_0)$ admits a neighborhood $U$ in the $(t,\theta)$-plane such that the restriction $s|_U$ has a continuous inverse.
It remains to apply \ref{cor:reg-parmeterization}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:star-shaped-disc}.} 
The solutions of these exercises are built on the following general construction known as the \index{Moser trick}\emph{Moser trick}.

Suppose that $\vec u_t$ is a smooth time-dependent vector field on a plane.
Consider the ordinary differential equation $x'(t)=\vec u_t(x(t))$.
Consider the map $\iota\:x(0)\mapsto x(1)$ where $t\mapsto x(t)$ is a solution of the equation.
The map $\iota$ is called the \index{flow}\emph{flow} of the vector field $\vec u_t$ for the time interval $[0,1]$.
Observe that according to \ref{thm:ODE} the map $\iota$ is smooth in its domain of definition.
Moreover the same holds for its inverse $\iota^{-1}$;
indeed, $\iota^{-1}$ is the flow of the vector field $-\vec u_{1-t}$.
That is, $\iota$ is a diffeomorphism from its domain of definition to its image. 


Therefore, in order to construct a diffeomorphism from one open subset of the plane to another it is sufficient to construct a smooth vector field such that its flow maps one set to the other;
such a map is automatically a diffeomorphism.

$\gamma_i(1)=q_i$, and $\gamma_i(t)\ne \gamma_j(t)$ if $i\ne j$.

Choose a smooth vector field $\vec v_t$ such that $\vec v_t(\gamma_i(t))=\gamma'_i(t)$ for any $i$ and $t$.
We can assume in addition that $\vec v_t$ vanishes outside of a sufficiently large disc; this can be arranged by  multiplying the vector field by a function 
$\sigma_1(R-|x|)$; see page \pageref{page:sigma-function}.

It remains to apply the Moser trick to the constructed vector field.

Without loss of generality we can assume that the origin belongs to both $\Sigma$ and~$\Theta$.

In each case show that there is a vector field $\vec v$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\{0\}$ that flows $\Sigma$ to $\Theta$.
In fact one can choose radial fields of that type,
but be careful with the cases \ref{SHORT.ex:star-shaped-disc:nonsmooth} and \ref{SHORT.ex:star-shaped-disc:star-shaped} --- they are not as easy as one might think.

Since $\gamma$ is a curvature line in $\Sigma_1$,  
$\Norm_1'$ is proportional to $\gamma'$;
in particular $\langle\Norm_1',\Norm_2\rangle=0$.

By the assumption, $\langle \Norm_1(t),\Norm_2(t)\rangle$ is constant.
By taking its derivative and applying the above identity, show that $\langle\Norm_1,\Norm_2'\rangle=0$.

Observe that these two families are orthogonal to each other.

Suppose that a point $p$ lies in the intersection $\Pi\cap\Sigma$.

Show that if the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is parallel to $\Pi$,

It follows that if $\gamma$ is a connected component of the intersection $\Pi\cap\Sigma$ that is not an isolated point,
then $\Pi$ \index{transversality}\emph{intersects $\Sigma$ transversally} along $\gamma$;
that is, at each point $p \in \gamma$ the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is not parallel to $\Pi$.
Apply the implicit function theorem to show that $\gamma$ is a smooth regular curve.

Denote by $\vec u_n$ the unit vector in the direction of $x_n$; that is $\vec u_n=\tfrac{x_n}{|x_n|}$.

Since the unit sphere is compact, we can pass to a subsequence of $(x_n)$ such that $\vec u_n$ converges to a unit vector $\vec u$.
Show that the half-line from the origin in the direction of $\vec u$ can be taken as $\ell$.

Arguing by contradiction, suppose that for some sequence $(x_n,y_n)\z\to(x_\infty,y_\infty)\in \partial\Omega$ the sequence $f(x_n,y_n)$ stays bounded above.
We can pass to a subsequence such that either $f(x_n,y_n)$ converges to some finite value $z_\infty$ or it diverges to $-\infty$.

In the first case, show that the point $(x_\infty, y_\infty,z_\infty)$ does not lie on $\Sigma$, but it has arbitrarily close points on $\Sigma$.
That is $\Sigma$ is not proper --- a contradiction.

If $f(x_n,y_n)\to -\infty$, use the convexity of $f$ to show that $f(\tfrac{x_n}2 ,\tfrac{y_n}2)\z\to -\infty$.
Note that origin belongs to $\Omega$;
use it to show that $(\tfrac{x_\infty}2, \tfrac{y_\infty}2)\in\Omega$.
Arrive to a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:open+convex=plane}.}
By \ref{ex:convex-proper-plane:d}, $\Sigma$ is parametrized by an open convex plane domain $\Omega$.
It remains to show that $\Omega$ can parametrize the whole plane.

We may assume that the origin of the plane lies in $\Omega$.
Show that in this case the boundary of $\Omega$ can be written in polar coordinates as $(\theta,f(\theta))$ where $f\:\mathbb{S}^1\to\mathbb{R}$ is a positive continuous function.
Then homeomorphism to the plane can be described in polar coordinates by changing only the radial coordinate;

Denote by $\bar\ell_t$ the projection of $\ell_t$ to the $(x, y)$-plane.
Show that the derivative $\tfrac{d}{dt}h_t(w)$ vanishes at the point $w$ if and only if $w\in \bar\ell_t$ 
and the derivative changes sign if $w$ goes from one side of $\bar\ell_t$ to the other.

Denote by $\bar\gamma$ the projection of $\gamma$ to the $(x, y)$-plane.
If $\bar\gamma$ is star shaped with respect to a point $w$, then $w$ cannot cross $\bar\ell_t$.
Therefore the function $t\mapsto h_t(w)$ is monotonic on $\mathbb{S}^1$.
Observe that this function cannot be constant, and arrive at a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:crosss}.}
This problem follows easily from the so-called \index{Morse lemma}\emph{Morse lemma}.
The following sketch is a slightly stripped version of it.
A more conceptual proof can be built on the Moser's trick \cite{palais}.

\medskip

Choose tangent-normal coordinates at $p$ so that the coordinate axes point in the principal directions of $\Sigma$ at $p$;
let $z=f(x,y)$ be the local graph representation of $\Sigma$.
We need to show that the solution of the equation $f(x,y)=0$ is a union of two smooth curves that intersect transversely at $p$.

Prove the following claim:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Suppose that  $x\mapsto h(x)$ is a smooth function defined in an open interval $\mathbb{I}\ni0$ such that $h(0)=h'(0)=0$ and $h''(0)>0$.
 Then, for a smaller interval $\mathbb{J}\ni0$ there is a unique smooth function $a\:\mathbb{J}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $h=a^2$, $a(0)=0$ and $a'(0)> 0$.
\end{itemize}
Note that by passing to a small rectangular domain $|x|,|y|<\epsilon$, we can assume that $f_{xx}>\epsilon$ and $f_{yy}<-\epsilon$. 
Show that if $\epsilon$ is small, then for every $x$ there is unique $y(x)$ such that $f_x(x,y(x))=0$; 
moreover the function $x\mapsto y(x)$ is smooth.

Set $h(x)=f(x,y(x))$.
Note that $h(0)=h'(0)=0$ and $h''>0$.
Applying the claim, we get a function $a$ such that $h=a^2$, where $a(0)=0$ and $a'(0)>0$.

Observe that $g(x,y)=h(x)-f(x,y)\ge 0$ and $g_y(x,y(x))\z=g(x,y(x))\z=0$ and $g_{yy}>0$.
Applying the claim to each function $y\mapsto g(x,y)$ with fixed $x$, we get that $g(x,y)=b(x,y)^2$ for a smooth function $b$ such that 
$b(x,y(x))=0$ and $b_y(x,y(x))>0$.

It follows that 
\begin{align*}
f(x,y)&=a(x)^2-b(x,y)^2=
(a(x)-b(x,y))\cdot (a(x)+b(x,y)).
\end{align*}
That is $f(x,y)=0$ if $a(x)\pm b(x,y) =0$.

It remains to observe that the two functions $g_\pm(x,y)=a(x)\pm b(x,y)$ have distinct non-zero gradients at $0$.
Therefore each equation $a(x)\pm b(x,y) =0$ defines a smooth regular curve in a neighborhood of $p$;
see Section~\ref{sec:implicit-curves}.





\parbf{\ref{ex:length-of-bry}.} Use \ref{lem:convex-saddle} and the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}).

Assume $\Sigma$ is an open saddle surface that lies in a cone $K$.
Show that there is a plane $\Pi$ that cuts $\Sigma$ and cuts from $K$ a compact region.
Conclude that $\Pi$ cuts from $\Sigma$ a compact region as well.

By \ref{lem:reg-section} one can move the plane $\Pi$ slightly so that it cuts from $\Sigma$ a compact surface with boundary.
Apply \ref{lem:convex-saddle}.


\parbf{\ref{ex:disc-hat}.} 
Consider the radial projection of $F_\epsilon$ to the sphere $\Sigma$ with center at $p=(0,0,\epsilon)$;
that is, a point $q\in F_\epsilon$ is mapped to a point $s(q)$ on the sphere that lies on the ray $pq$.

Show that $s$ is a diffeomorphism from $F_\epsilon$ to the south hemisphere of~$\Sigma$.
It remains to observe that the  unit disc is diffeomorphic to the hemisphere.

\parbf{\ref{ex:saddle-graph}.}
Suppose that orthogonal projection of $\Sigma$ to the $(x,y)$-plane is not injective.
Show that there is a point $p\in\Sigma$ with a vertical tangent plane;
that is, $\T_p\Sigma$ is perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane.

Let $\Gamma_p$ be the connected component of $p$ in the intersection of $\Sigma$ and the affine tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$.
Use \ref{ex:crosss} to show that $\Gamma_p$ is a union of smooth regular curves that can cross each other transversely.
Moreover two of these curves pass thru $p$ and $\Gamma_p$ does not bound a compact region on $\Sigma$.

Show that $\Gamma_p$ must have at least 4 ways to escape to infinity.
On the other hand, since $\Sigma$ is a graph outside of compact set $K$, we have that $\Gamma_p\backslash K$ is a graph of a real-to-real function that has only two ways to escape to infinity --- a contradiction.

Cut the lateral surface of the ice-mountain by a line from the cowboy to the tip;
unfold it on the plane (see the picture) and try to figure out what is the image of the strained lasso.

\parbf{\ref{ex:length-dist-conv}.} 
Note that by \ref{thm:convex-embedded}, $\Sigma$ bounds a strictly convex region.
Therefore we can assume that $\Norm(p)\ne\Norm(q)$, otherwise $p=q$ and the inequality is evident.

Further, we can assume that $\Norm(p)+\Norm(q)\ne 0$, otherwise the right hand side is undefined.


In the remaining case the tangent planes $\T_p$ and $\T_q$ intersect along a line, say $\ell$.
Set $\alpha=\tfrac12\cdot\measuredangle(\Norm(p),\Norm(q))$;
observe that $2\cdot\cos\alpha= |\Norm(p)+\Norm(q)|$.
Let $x\in \ell$ be the point that minimizes the sum $|p-x|\z+|x-q|$.
Show that $\measuredangle\hinge xpq\ge \pi-2\cdot\alpha$.
Conclude that 
\[|p-x|+|x-q|\le \frac{|p-q|}{\cos\alpha}.\]

Finally, apply \ref{cor:shorts+convex} to show that
\[\dist{p}{q}\Sigma\le |p-x|+|x-q|.\]


\parbf{\ref{ex:hat-convex}.} Suppose there is a minimizing curve $\gamma\not\subset\Delta$ with endpoints $p$ and $q$ in $\Delta$.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that only one arc of $\gamma$ lies outside of $\Delta$.
Reflection of this arc  with respect to $\Pi$ together with the remaining part of $\gamma$ forms another curve $\hat\gamma$ from $p$ to $q$;
it runs partly along $\Sigma$ 
and partly outside $\Sigma$,
but does not get inside $\Sigma$.
Note that
\[\length\hat\gamma=\length\gamma.\]


Denote by $\bar\gamma$ the closest point projection of $\hat\gamma$ on $\Sigma$.
Note that the curve $\bar\gamma$ lies in $\Sigma$, 
it has the same ends as $\gamma$,
and by \ref{cor:shorts+convex}
\[\length\bar\gamma<\length\gamma.\]
This means that $\gamma$ is not length minimizing,

\parbf{\ref{ex:clairaut}.} 
We can assume that the origin lies on the axis of revolution and $\vec i$ points in the direction of such axis.
Use \ref{lem:constant-speed} to show that it is sufficient to prove that 
$\langle\gamma'\times \gamma,\vec i\rangle$
is constant.

Since $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$, the three vectors $\vec i$, $\gamma$, and $\gamma''$ lie in the same plane.
In particular $\langle\gamma''\times \gamma,\vec i\rangle=0$.
Therefore
$
\langle\gamma'\times \gamma,\vec i\rangle'
=
\langle\gamma'\times \gamma',\vec i\rangle+\langle\gamma''\times \gamma,\vec i\rangle =0
$.



\parbf{\ref{ex:asymptotic-geodesic}.} By Lemma \ref{lem:constant-speed},
we can assume that $\gamma$ is parametrized by arc-length.
By the definition of geodesic, we have that $\gamma''(s)\perp\T_{\gamma(s)}$. 
Therefore 
\[\gamma''(s)=k_n(s)\cdot\Norm(\gamma(s)),\]
where $k_n(s)$ is the normal curvature of $\gamma$ at time $s$.
Since $\gamma$ is asymptotic, $k_n(s)\equiv 0$;
that is, $\gamma''(s)\equiv 0$, therefore $\gamma'$ is constant and $\gamma$ runs along a line segment; see \ref{ex:zero-curvature-curve}.




\parbf{\ref{ex:reflection-geodesic}.}
Denote by $\mu$ a unit vector perpendicular to $\Pi$.
Since $\gamma$ lies in $\Pi$, we have that $\gamma''$ is parallel to $\Pi$, or equivalently $\gamma''\perp \mu$.
Since $\gamma$ is unit speed, \ref{prop:a'-pertp-a''} implies that $\gamma''\perp\gamma'$.

Since $\Sigma$ is mirror symmetric with respect to the plane $\Pi$,
the tangent plane $\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$ is also mirror symmetric with respect to  $\Pi$ as well.
It follows that $\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$ is spanned by $\mu$ and $\gamma'(t)$.
Hence $\gamma''\perp \mu$ and $\gamma''\perp\gamma'$ imply $\gamma''\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$;
that is, $\gamma$ is a geodesic.



\parbf{\ref{ex:round-torus}.}
By \ref{ex:reflection-geodesic}, any meridian of $\Sigma$ is a closed geodesic.
Consider an arbitrary closed geodesic $\gamma$.

In the case when $\gamma$ is tangent to a meridian at some point, then by the  uniqueness part of Proposition \ref{prop:geod-existence},
 $\gamma$ runs along that meridian; in particular it is non-contractible.

In the remaining case, $\gamma$ can intersect meridians only transversely.
Therefore the longitude of $\gamma$ is monotonic.
Whence again $\gamma$ is non-contractible.


\parbf{\ref{ex:helix=geodesic}.}
Show that $\Norm(\gamma(t))=(\cos t,\sin t, 0)$.
Calculate $\gamma''(t)$ and show that it is proportional to $\Norm(\gamma(t))$.
The latter is equivalent to $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$. 
Note that the line segment from $\gamma (0) $ to $\gamma (2 \pi) $ is contained in $\Sigma$.



\parbf{\ref{ex:two-min-geod}.}
Assume that two shortest paths $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have two common points $p$ and $q$.
Denote by $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ the arcs of
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ from $p$ to $q$.
Suppose that $\alpha_1$ is distinct from $\beta_1$.

Note that $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ are shortest paths with the same endpoints;
in particular they have the same length.
Exchanging $\alpha_1$ in $\alpha$ to $\beta_1$ produces a shortest path, say $\hat\alpha$, that is distinct from $\alpha$.
By \ref{prop:gamma''}, $\hat\alpha$ is a geodesic.

Suppose $\alpha_1$ is a proper subarc of $\alpha$;
that is, $\alpha_1\ne\alpha$, or equivalently, either $p$ or $q$ is not an endpoint of $\alpha$.
Then $\alpha$ and $\hat\alpha$ share one point and velocity vector at this point.
By \ref{prop:geod-existence} $\alpha$ coincides with $\hat\alpha$ --- a contradiction.

It follows that $p$ and $q$ are the endpoints of $\alpha$. Analogously,  $p$ and $q$ are the endpoints of $\beta$.

For the second part, one could consider two distinct curves of the form 
\[ \gamma_b(t) = ( \cos t , \sin t , bt  )  , t \in \mathbb{R}  \]
in the cylinder $x^2 + y^2 =1$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:min-geod+plane}.}
Assume a shortest path $\alpha$ crosses $\Pi$ at least twice.
In this case there is an arc $\alpha_1$ of $\alpha$ that lies entirely on one side
 on $\Pi$,  has ends on $\Pi$, and these ends are distinct from the ends of $\alpha$.

Let us remove the arc $\alpha_1$ from $\alpha$ and replace it with the reflection of $\alpha_1$ across $\Pi$.
Note that the obtained curve, say $\beta$, lies in the surface; it has the same length as $\alpha$, and it connects the same pair of points, say $p$ and $q$.
Therefore $\beta$ is another shortest path from $p$ to $q$ in $\Sigma$ that is distinct from $\alpha$.

By \ref{prop:gamma''}, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are geodesics.
Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have a common subarc, they share one point and velocity vector at this point;
by \ref{prop:geod-existence} $\alpha$ coincides with $\beta$ --- a contradiction.


\parbf{\ref{ex:milka}.} Let $W$ be the closed region outside of $\Sigma$. Show that the distance $\dist{p^t}{q}W$ is constant with respect to $t$. This implies that the concatenation of the line segment $[p^t,\gamma(t)]$ and the arc $\gamma|_{[t,\ell]}$ is a shortest path from $p^t$ to $q$  in $W$. Since $\Sigma$ is strictly convex, 
\[ \dist{\gamma (t)}{q}W > \dist{\gamma(t)}{q}{\mathbb{R}^3}  \]
for all $t < \ell$. Hence 

\[
\begin{aligned}
 \dist{p^t}{q}W  &=  \dist{p^t}{\gamma(t)}W + \dist{\gamma (t)}{q}W   
\\
&> \dist{p^t}{\gamma(t)}{\mathbb{R}^3} + \dist{ \gamma (t)}{q}{\mathbb{R}^3}   
\\
&\geq  \dist{p^t}{q}{\mathbb{R}^3}.   
\end{aligned}
\]
If the segment $[p^t , q ]$ was entirely contained in $W$ for some $t< \ell $, then $ \dist{p^t}{q}W = \dist{p^t}{q}{\mathbb{R}^3} $, which would be a contradiction.


%Strictly speaking, this solution requires the first variation formula, which students don't have right now.

\parbf{\ref{ex:rho''}.}
Equip $\Sigma$ with unit normal field $\Norm$ that points inside.
Denote by $k(t)$ the normal curvature of $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(t)$ in the direction of $\gamma'(t)$.
Since $\Sigma$ is convex, $k(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$.

Since $\gamma$ is a geodesic, we have $\gamma''(t)=k(t)\cdot\Norm(\gamma(t))$.

Since $\gamma$ has unit speed, $\langle\gamma'(t),\gamma'(t)\rangle=1$ for any $t$.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that $p$ is the origin of~$\mathbb{R}^3$.
Since $p$ is inside $\Sigma$, we have that $\langle\gamma(t),\Norm(\gamma(t))\rangle\le 0$ for any $t$.
It follows that 
\[\langle\gamma''(t),\gamma(t)\rangle=k(t)\cdot \langle\gamma(t),\Norm(\gamma(t))\rangle\le 0\]
for any $t$.

Applying the above estimates, we get 
\begin{align*}
\rho''(t)
&=\langle\gamma(t),\gamma(t)\rangle''
=2\cdot\langle\gamma''(t),\gamma(t)\rangle+2\cdot\langle\gamma'(t),\gamma'(t)\rangle
\le 2.
\end{align*}


\parbf{\ref{ex:tc-spherical-image}.}
We can assume $\gamma$ is parametrized by arc-length. If we write $\nu (t) = \nu ( \gamma (t)) $, then  $\langle \gamma'(t) , \nu (t) \rangle \equiv 0$. Also, since $\gamma$ is a geodesic, we have that $\gamma''(t) \parallel \nu (t)$. Then
\[
\begin{aligned}
 | \gamma''(t) |  &=  | \langle \gamma '' (t) , \nu (t) \rangle |   
\\
&=   | \langle \gamma ' (t) , \nu (t) \rangle ' - \langle \gamma '(t) , \nu ' (t) \rangle |   
\\

\\
& \leq |\gamma ' (t) | |\nu ' (t)|

\parbf{\ref{ex:semigeodesc-chart}.}
By the Gauss lemma (\ref{lem:palar-perp}), polar coordinates with respect to $q$ produce a semigeodesic chart at any nearby point.
Therefore, it is sufficient to find a point $q\ne p$ such that polar coordinates on $\Sigma$ with respect to $q$ cover $p$.
By \ref{prop:exp}, any $q$ sufficiently close to $p$ does the job.

Show that we can choose an orientation on $\Sigma$ so that $b_r(0,\theta)\z=1$ for any $\theta$.
Conclude that we can assume that $b(r,\theta)>0$ for small positive values $r$.

Suppose $b(r_1,\theta_1)<0$ at some pair $(r_1,\theta_1)$ with $0<r_1<r_0$.
Observe that if $\theta_2$ is sufficiency close to $\theta_1$ then the radial curves $r\mapsto b(r,\theta_1)$ and $r\mapsto b(r,\theta_2)$ defined on the interval $(0,r_1)$ intersect.
Therefore $\exp_p$ is not injective in $B$ --- a contradiction.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:inj-rad:0}.}
Suppose that $b(r_1,\theta_1)=0$.
Apply \ref{SHORT.ex:inj-rad:sign} to show that $b_r(r_1,\theta_1)=0$.

Apply \ref{prop:jaccobi} to conclude $b(r,\theta_1)=0$ for any $r$.
The latter contradicts that $b_r(0,\theta_1)=1$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:inj-rad:prop:inj-rad}.}
We need to show that $\exp_p$ is regular in $B$.
Suppose that vector $\vec v\in B$ has polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ for some $r>0$.
Show that $\exp_p$ is regular at $\vec v$ if $b(r,\theta)\ne 0$.
Conclude that $\exp_p$ is regular in $B\backslash \{0\}$.

By \ref{obs:d(exp)=1}, $\exp_p$ is regular at $0$.
Whence $\exp_p|_B$ is a regular injective smooth map.
Use the inverse function theorem (\ref{thm:inverse}) to show that the restriction $\exp_p|_B$ is a diffeomorphism to its image. 
 



\parbf{\ref{lem:K(orthogonal)}}; \ref{SHORT.lem:K(orthogonal):uu-vv}.
Since the frame $\vec u, \vec v,\Norm$ is orthonormal,
the first two vector identities are equivalent to the following six real identities:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\langle\vec u_u,\vec u\rangle
&=0,
&
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle
&=-\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v,
&
\langle\vec u_u,\Norm\rangle
&=a\cdot \ell,
\\
\langle\vec v_u,\vec v\rangle
&=0,
&
\langle\vec v_u,\vec u\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v,
&
\langle\vec v_u,\Norm\rangle
&=
a\cdot m.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:key-orthogonal/2}
\]

Taking the partial derivatives of the identities
$\langle\vec u,\vec u\rangle=1$ and
$\langle\vec v,\vec v\rangle=1$ with respect to $u$
we get the first two identities in \ref{eq:key-orthogonal/2}.

Further, observe that
\[
\begin{aligned}
\vec v_u
&=
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}
(\tfrac1b\cdot  s_v)=\tfrac1b\cdot s_{uv}
+
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}(\tfrac1b)
\cdot
 s_v.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:dv/du}
\]
Since $s_u\perp s_v$, it follows that
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec v_u,\vec u\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{a\cdot b}\cdot \langle s_{vu}, s_u\rangle
=
\tfrac1{2\cdot a\cdot b}\cdot \tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}\langle s_u, s_u\rangle=
\tfrac1{2\cdot a\cdot b}\cdot \tfrac{\partial a^2}{\partial v}=
\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v.
\end{align*}
Taking the partial derivative of $\langle\vec u,\vec v\rangle=0$ with respect to $u$
we get
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec v_u,\vec u\rangle+
\langle\vec v,\vec u_u\rangle
&=0.
\end{align*}
Hence we get two more identities in \ref{eq:key-orthogonal/2}.

Since $\vec u, \vec v$ is an orthonormal frame, by \ref{thm:shape-chart} we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
\tfrac1{a^2}
\cdot
\langle s_{uu},\Norm\rangle
&=\ell,
&
\tfrac1{a\cdot b}
\cdot
\langle s_{uv},\Norm\rangle
&=m,
\\
\tfrac1{a\cdot b}
\cdot
\langle s_{vu},\Norm\rangle
&=m,
&
\tfrac1{b^2}
\cdot
\langle s_{vv},\Norm\rangle
&=n.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:shape-lmn}
\]

Applying  \ref{eq:dv/du}, \ref{eq:shape-lmn}, and $s_v\perp\Norm$ we get
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec u_u,\Norm\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{a}\cdot \langle s_{uu},\Norm\rangle
=a\cdot \ell,
&
\langle\vec v_u,\Norm\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{a}\cdot \langle s_{uv},\Norm\rangle
=a\cdot m,
\end{align*}
that imply the last two equalities in \ref{eq:key-orthogonal/2}.

Therefore the first two identities in \ref{SHORT.lem:K(orthogonal):uu-vv} are proved;
the remaining two identities can be proved along the same lines.

Recall that the Gauss curvature equals the determinant of the matrix $
(\begin{smallmatrix}
\ell&m

$;
that is, $K=\ell\cdot n-m^2$.
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
a\cdot b\cdot K
&=
a\cdot b\cdot(\ell\cdot n-m^2)
=
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v_v\rangle 
-
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v_u\rangle
\\
&= 
\left(
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle
-
\cancel{\langle\vec u_{uv},\vec v\rangle}
\right)-
\left(
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v\rangle
-
\cancel{\langle\vec u_{uv},\vec v\rangle}
\right)=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}(-\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v)
-
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}(\tfrac1{a}\cdot b_u).

Choose two points $x,z\in\Sigma$;
let $y$ be the midpoint of $[x,z]$.
Denote by $\bar x$ and $\bar z$ the points on $\delta$ that minimize the distances to $x$ and $z$ respectively;
so we have
$f(x)
=\dist{x}{\bar x}\Sigma$,
and $f(z)=\dist{z}{\bar z}\Sigma$.

Since $\Delta$ is convex, the midpoint of $[\bar x,\bar z]$, say  $\bar y$, lies in $\Delta$.
By \ref{ex:convex-dist}, we have 
\begin{align*}
f(y)&\le \dist{y}{\bar y}\Sigma
\le
\tfrac12\cdot(\dist{x}{\bar x}\Sigma
+
\dist{z}{\bar z}\Sigma)

Let $q$ be a point on $\delta$ that minimize the distance to $p$.

Chose small $t>0$ and set $x\z=\gamma(t)$.
Consider a model triangle $[\tilde p\tilde q\tilde x]\z=\tilde\triangle(pqx)$.
Let $\tilde\delta$ be the line thru $\tilde q$ perpendicular to $[\tilde p,\tilde q]$.
Denote by $\tilde y$ the orthogonal projection of $\tilde x$ to $\tilde\delta$.
By comparison we have that 
\begin{align*}
\phi
=\measuredangle\hinge qpx
&\ge \modangle qpx
\mathrel{=:}\tilde\phi,
\\
\psi\df
\measuredangle\hinge pqx
&\ge 
\modangle pqx
\mathrel{=:}\tilde \psi
\end{align*}

Since $t=\dist{\tilde p}{\tilde x}{\mathbb{R}^2}$ is small, so is the distances $\dist{\tilde q}{\tilde y}{\mathbb{R}^2}$.
Therefore we can choose a point $y$ on $\delta$ such that $\dist{q}{y}\Sigma=\dist{\tilde q}{\tilde y}{\mathbb{R}^2}$.
Moreover, if we choose in on the {}\emph{right side}, then $\tfrac\pi2-\psi \ge \measuredangle\hinge qxy$.
By construction and comparison, we have 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle\hinge {\tilde q}{\tilde x}{\tilde y}&=\tfrac\pi2-\tilde\psi
\ge
\tfrac\pi2-\psi
\ge
\measuredangle\hinge q x y
\ge 
\modangle q x y.
\end{align*}
Therefore $\dist{x}{y}\Sigma\le \dist{\tilde x}{\tilde y}{\mathbb{R}}$.
Since $\tilde\phi\le\phi$, we get that
\begin{align*}
f\circ\gamma(t)&\le \dist{x}{y}\Sigma\le 
\dist{\tilde x}{\tilde y}{\mathbb{R}}=
\\
&=
\dist{p}{q}\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\tilde\phi
\le
\dist{p}{q}\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\phi.

That is, we proved \ref{eq:dist<cosphi} for small $t>0$.
The case $t<0$ can be done along the same lines.

Let $\vec u_\infty$ be a partial limit of $\vec u_n$.

Show that the geodesic that starts from $p$ in the direction of $\vec u_\infty$ is a half-line that runs in $K$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:half-line:suplevel}.} The concavity of $f$ follows from \ref{prop:busemann+}.
Whence the convexity of $S_c$ follows.

Suppose that $S_c$ is not compact.
Note that we can assume that $p\in S_c$.
Then by \ref{SHORT.ex:half-line:exist} there is a half-line $\lambda$ that starts at $p$ and runs in $S_c$ for some $c$.
It remains to observe that $f\circ\lambda(t)+t=0$ and use it to arrive at a contradiction.

In the Euclidean plane $S_s$ is a single point.
In the cylinder, $S_s$ is a circle.
The surface of $r$-neighborhood of an infinite rectangle provides an example with a line segment as $S_s$; this example is not smooth, but it can be smoothed keeping this property.
