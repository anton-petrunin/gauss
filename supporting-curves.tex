\section{Cooriented tangent curves}

Suppose $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are smooth regular plane curves.
Recall that the curves $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are tangent at the  time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$
if $\gamma_1(t_1)=\gamma_2(t_2)$
and they share the tangent line at these time parameters.
In this case the point $p=\gamma_1(t_1)=\gamma_2(t_2)$ is called a \index{point!of tangency}\emph{point of tangency} of the curves.
If both curves are simple, then without ambiguity we may say that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are tangent at the point $p$.

Note that if $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are tangent at the time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$, 
then the velocity vectors $\gamma_1'(t_1)$ and $\gamma_2'(t_2)$ are parallel.

If $\gamma_1'(t_1)$ and $\gamma_2'(t_2)$ have the same direction, we say that the curves are \index{cooriented!curves}\emph{cooriented},
if their directions are opposite, the curves are called \index{controriented!curves}\emph{counteroriented}.


Note that reverting the parametrization of one of the curves, cooriented curves become counteroriented and vice versa; so we can always assume the curves are cooriented at any given point of tangency.

\section{Supporting curves}

Let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be two smooth regular plane curves that share a point \[p=\gamma_1(t_1)=\gamma_2(t_2)\] which is not an endpoint of any of the curves.
Suppose that there is $\epsilon>0$ such that the arc $\gamma_2|_{[t_2-\epsilon, t_2+\epsilon]}$ lies in a closed plane region $R$ with the arc $\gamma_1|_{[t_1-\epsilon, t_1+\epsilon]}$ in its boundary,
then we say that $\gamma_1$ \index{local!support}\emph{locally supports} $\gamma_2$ at the time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$.
If both curves are simple, then  without ambiguity we also could say that $\gamma_1$ {}\emph{locally supports} $\gamma_2$ at the point $p$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{43 mm}
\vskip-3mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-86}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

If the curves on the diagram are oriented according to the arrows, then $\gamma_1$ supports $\gamma_2$ from the right at $p$ (as well as $\gamma_2$ supports $\gamma_1$ from the left at~$p$).

Suppose $\gamma_1$ is a simple proper curve, so it divides the plane into two closed regions that lie on the left and right from $\gamma_1$.
Then we say that $\gamma_1$ \index{global support}\emph{globally supports} $\gamma_2$ at $t_2$ 
if $\gamma_2$ runs in one of these closed regions and 
$\gamma_2(t_2)$ lies on $\gamma$.

Further, suppose $\gamma_2$ is closed, so it divides the plane into two regions.
We say that a point lies {}\emph{inside} (respectively, {}\emph{outside}) of $\gamma_2$ if it lies in the bounded region (respectively, unbounded) region.
In this case we say that $\gamma_1$ supports $\gamma_2$ \index{support from inside}\emph{from inside} (\index{support from outside}\emph{from outside}) if $\gamma_1$ supports $\gamma_2$ and lies in the region inside it (respectively outside it). 

Note that if $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ share a point $p=\gamma_1(t_1)=\gamma_2(t_2)$ and are not tangent at $t_1$ and $t_2$, then at time $t_2$ the curve $\gamma_2$ crosses $\gamma_1$  moving from one of its sides to the other.
It follows that $\gamma_1$ cannot locally support $\gamma_2$ at the time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$.
Whence we get the following:

\begin{thm}{Definition-Observation}
Let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be two smooth regular plane curves.
Suppose $\gamma_1$ locally supports $\gamma_2$ at time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$.
Then $\gamma_1$ is tangent to $\gamma_2$ at $t_1$ and $t_2$.

In such a case, if the curves are cooriented and the region $R$ in the definition of supporting curves lies on the right (left) from the arc of $\gamma_1$, then we say that 
$\gamma_1$ supports $\gamma_2$ from the left (respectively right).
\end{thm}

We say that a smooth regular plane curve $\gamma$ has a \index{vertex of  curve}\emph{vertex} at $s$
if the signed curvature function is critical at $s$;
that is, if $\skur'(s)_\gamma=0$.
If in addition to that, $\gamma$ is simple, we could say that the point $p=\gamma(s)$ is a vertex of $\gamma$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:vertex-support}
Assume that the osculating circle $\sigma_s$ of a smooth regular simple plane curve $\gamma$ locally supports $\gamma$ at $p=\gamma(s)$.
Show that $p$ is a vertex of $\gamma$.
\end{thm}

\section{Supporting test}

The following proposition resembles the second derivative test. 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:supporting-circline}
Let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be two smooth regular plane curves.

Suppose $\gamma_1$ locally supports $\gamma_2$ from the left (right) at the time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$.
Then 
\[\skur_1(t_1)\le \skur_2(t_2)\quad(\text{respectively}\quad \skur_1(t_1)\ge \skur_2(t_2)).\]
where $\skur_1$ and $\skur_2$ denote the signed curvature of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ respectively.

A partial converse also holds.
Namely, if $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ tangent and cooriented at the time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$
then $\gamma_1$ locally supports $\gamma_2$ from the left (right) at the time parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$
if 
\[\skur_1(t_1)< \skur_2(t_2)\quad(\text{respectively}\quad \skur_1(t_1)> \skur_2(t_2)).\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} Without loss of generality, we can assume that $t_1=t_2=0$, the shared point $\gamma_1(0)=\gamma_2(0)$ is the origin and the velocity vectors $\gamma'_1(0)$, $\gamma'_2(0)$ point in the direction of $x$-axis.

Note that small arcs of $\gamma_1|_{[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]}$ and  $\gamma_2|_{[-\epsilon,+\epsilon]}$ can be described as a graph 
$y=f_1(x)$ and $y=f_2(x)$ for smooth functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ such that $f_i(0)=0$ and $f_i'(0)=0$.
Note that $f_1''(0)=\skur_1(0)$ and $f_2''(0)=\skur_2(0)$ (see \ref{ex:curvature-graph})

Clearly, $\gamma_1$ supports $\gamma_2$ from the left (right) if 
\[f_1(x)\le f_2(x)\quad(\text{respectively}\quad f_1(x)\ge f_2(x))\]
for all sufficiently small values of $x$.
Applying the second derivative test, we get the result.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:support}
Let $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ be two smooth unit-speed simple plane curves that are tangent and cooriented at the point $p\z=\gamma_0(0)\z=\gamma_1(0)$.
Assume $\skur_0(s)\le\skur_1(s)$ for any $s$.
Show that $\gamma_0$ locally supports $\gamma_1$ from the right at $p$.

Give an example of two proper curves $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ satisfying the above condition such that $\gamma_0$ does not support $\gamma_1$ at $p$ globally.
\end{thm}

Note that according to \ref{thm:DNA} for any closed smooth regular curve that runs in a unit disc, the average of its absolute curvature is at least 1; in particular, there is a point where the absolute curvature is at least 1.
The following exercise says that this statement also holds for loops.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:in-circle}
Assume a closed smooth regular plane loop $\gamma$ runs in a unit disc.
Show that there is a point on $\gamma$ with absolute curvature at least~1.

Assume a closed smooth regular plane curve $\gamma$ runs between two parallel lines at distance 2 from each other.
Show that there is a point on $\gamma$ with absolute curvature at least 1.

Try to prove the same for a smooth regular plane loop.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:in-triangle}
Assume a closed smooth regular plane curve $\gamma$ runs inside of a triangle $\triangle$ with inradius 1; that is, the circle tangent to all three sides of $\triangle$ has radius 1.

\section{Convex curves}

Recall that a plane curve is convex if it bounds a convex region.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:convex}
Suppose that a closed simple plane curve $\gamma$ bounds a figure $F$.
Then $F$ is convex if and only if the signed curvature of $\gamma$ does not change sign.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Lens lemma}\label{lem:lens}
Let $\gamma$ be a smooth regular simple plane curve that runs from $x$ to $y$.
Assume that $\gamma$ runs on the right side (left side) of the oriented line $xy$ and only its endpoints $x$ and $y$ lie on the line.
Then $\gamma$ has a point with positive (respectively negative) signed curvature.
\end{thm}

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{35 mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-22}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the lemma fails for curves with self-intersections.
For example, the curve $\gamma$ on the diagram always turns right, 
so it has negative curvature everywhere, but it lies on the right side of the line $xy$.

}

\parit{Proof.}
Choose points $p$ and $q$ on the line $xy$
so that the points $p, x, y, q$ appear in that order.
We can assume that $p$ and $q$ lie sufficiently far from $x$ and $y$, so that the half-disc with diameter $pq$ contains~$\gamma$.

\begin{wrapfigure}[6]{o}{50 mm}
\vskip-3mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-24}
\end{wrapfigure}

Consider the smallest disc segment with chord $[p,q]$ that contains $\gamma$.
Note that its arc $\sigma$ supports $\gamma$ at some point $w=\gamma(t_0)$.

Let us parametrize $\sigma$ from $p$ to $q$.
Note that the $\gamma$ and $\sigma$ are tangent and cooriented at $w$.
If not, then the arc of $\gamma$ from $w$ to $y$ would be trapped in the curvilinear triangle $xwp$ bounded by the line segment $[p,x]$ and the arcs of $\sigma$, $\gamma$.
But this is impossible since $y$ does not belong to this triangle.

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{50 mm}
\vskip-2mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-23}
\bigskip
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-230}
\end{wrapfigure}

It follows that $\sigma$ supports $\gamma$ at $t_0$ from the right.
By \ref{prop:supporting-circline}, 
\[\skur(w)_\gamma\ge \skur_\sigma >0.\]
\qedsf

\parit{Remark.}
Instead of taking the minimal disc segment, one can take a point $w$ on $\gamma$ that maximizes the distance to the line $xy$.
The same argument shows that the curvature at $w$ is nonnegative, which is slightly weaker than the required positive curvature.

}

\parit{Proof of \ref{prop:convex}; ``only-if'' part.}
If $F$ is convex, then every tangent line of $\gamma$ supports $\gamma$.
If a point moves along $\gamma$, the figure $F$ has to stay on one side from its tangent line;
that is, we can assume that each tangent line supports $\gamma$ on one side, say on the right.
Since a line has vanishing curvature, the supporting test (\ref{prop:supporting-circline}) implies that $\skur\ge 0$ at each point.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{35 mm}
\vskip-3mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-68}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{``If'' part.}
Denote by $K$ the convex hull of $F$.
If $F$ is not convex, then $F$ is a proper subset of $K$.
Therefore $\partial K$ contains a line segment that is not a part of $\partial F$.
In other words, there is a line that supports $\gamma$ at two points, say $x$ and $y$ that divide $\gamma$ in two arcs $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, both distinct from the line segment $[x,y]$.

Note that one of the arcs $\gamma_1$ or $\gamma_2$ is parametrized from $x$ to $y$ and the other from $y$ to $x$.
Passing to a smaller arc if necessary we can ensure that only its endpoints lie on the line. 
Applying the lens lemma, we get that the arcs $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ contain points with signed curvatures of opposite signs.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex small}
Suppose $\gamma$ is a smooth regular simple closed convex plane curve of diameter larger than 2.
Show that $\gamma$ has a point with absolute curvature less than 1.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:line-curve-intersections}
Suppose $\gamma$ is a simple smooth regular plane curve with positive signed curvature.
Assume $\gamma$ crosses a line $\ell$ at the points $p_1,p_2,\z\dots, p_n$ and these points appear on $\gamma$ in the same order.

\section{Moon in a puddle}

The following theorem is a slight generalization of the theorem proved by Vladimir Ionin and German Pestov in \cite{ionin-pestov}.\index{Ionin--Pestov theorem}
For convex curves, this result was known earlier \cite[\S 24]{blaschke}.


\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{18 mm}
\vskip-6mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-67}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:moon-orginal}
Assume $\gamma$ is a simple closed smooth regular plane loop with absolute curvature bounded by 1.
Then it surrounds a unit disc.
\end{thm}

This theorem gives a simple but nontrivial example of the so-called \index{local!to global theorem}\emph{local to global theorems} --- based on some local data (in this case the curvature of a curve) we conclude a global property (in this case existence of a large disc surrounded by the curve).

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{33 mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-62}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

A straightforward approach would be to start with some disc in the region bounded by the curve and blow it up to maximize its radius.
However, as one may see from the spinner-like example on the diagram it does not always lead to a solution --- a closed plane curve of curvature at most 1 may surround a disc of radius smaller than 1 that cannot be enlarged continuously.

}

\begin{thm}{Key lemma}\label{thm:moon}
Assume $\gamma$ is a simple closed smooth regular plane loop.
Then at one point of $\gamma$ (distinct from its base) its osculating circle $\sigma$ globally supports $\gamma$ from the inside.
\end{thm}

First let us show that the theorem follows from the lemma.

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:moon-orginal} modulo \ref{thm:moon}.}
Since $\gamma$ has absolute curvature at most 1, each osculating circle has radius at least 1.
According to the key lemma one of the osculating circles $\sigma$ globally supports $\gamma$ from inside.
In particular $\sigma$ lies inside of $\gamma$, whence the result.
\qeds

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:moon}.}
Denote by $F$ the closed region surrounded by $\gamma$.
We can assume that $F$ lies on the left from $\gamma$.
Arguing by contradiction,
assume that the osculating circle at each point $p\in \gamma$ does not lie in $F$.

\begin{figure}[h!]%{r}{38 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-32}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Given a point $p\in\gamma$ let us consider the maximal circle $\sigma$ that lies completely in $F$ and tangent to $\gamma$ at $p$.
The circle $\sigma$ will be called the {}\emph{incircle} of $F$ at $p$.

Note that the curvature $\skur_\sigma$ of the incircle $\sigma$ has to be larger than $\skur(p)_\gamma$.
Indeed, since $\sigma$ supports $\gamma$ from the left, by \ref{prop:supporting-circline} we have $\skur_\sigma\ge \skur(p)_\gamma$; in the case of equality, $\sigma$ is the osculating circle at $p$.
The latter is impossible by our assumption.

It follows that $\sigma$ has to touch $\gamma$ at another point.
Otherwise we can increase $\sigma$ slightly while keeping it inside $F$.

Indeed, since $\skur_\sigma> \skur(p)_\gamma$, 
by \ref{prop:supporting-circline} we can choose a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that after a slight increase of $\sigma$, the intersection $U\cap \sigma$ is still in $F$.
On the other hand, if $\sigma$ does not touch $\gamma$ at another point, then after some (maybe smaller) increase of $\sigma$ the complement $\sigma\backslash U$ is still in $F$.
That is, a slightly increased $\sigma$ is still in $F$ --- a contradiction.



Choose a point $p_1$ on $\gamma$ that is distinct from its base point. 
Let $\sigma_1$ be the incircle at $p_1$.
Denote by $\gamma_1$ an arc of $\gamma$ from $p_1$ to a first point $q_1$ on $\sigma_1$.
Denote by $\hat\sigma_1$ and $\check\sigma_1$ two arcs of $\sigma_1$ from $p_1$ to $q_1$ such that the cyclic concatenation of $\hat\sigma_1$ and $\gamma_1$ surrounds~$\check\sigma_1$. 

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{32 mm}
\vskip-2mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-64}
\caption*{Two ovals pretend to be circles.}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Let $p_2$ be the midpoint of $\gamma_1$.
Denote by $\sigma_2$ the incircle at $p_2$.

Note that $\sigma_2$ cannot intersect $\hat\sigma_1$.
Otherwise, if $\sigma_2$ intersects $\hat\sigma_1$ at some point $s$, then $\sigma_2$ has to have two more common points with $\check\sigma_1$, say $x$ and $y$ --- one for each arc of $\sigma_2$ from $p_2$ to $s$.
Therefore $\sigma_1\z=\sigma_2$ since these two circles have three common points: $s$, $x$, and $y$. 
On the other hand, by construction, $p_2\in \sigma_2$ and $p_2\notin \sigma_1$ --- a contradiction.


Recall that $\sigma_2$ has to touch $\gamma$ at another point.
From above it follows that it can only touch $\gamma_1$ and therefore we can choose an arc $\gamma_2\subset \gamma_1$ that runs from $p_2$ to a first point $q_2$ on $\sigma_2$.
Since $p_2$ is the midpoint of $\gamma_1$, we have that
\[\length \gamma_2< \tfrac12\cdot\length\gamma_1.\eqlbl{eq:length<length/2}\]

Repeating this construction recursively,
we get an infinite sequence of arcs $\gamma_1\supset \gamma_2\supset\dots$;
by \ref{eq:length<length/2}, we also get that 
\[\length\gamma_n\to0\quad\text{as}\quad n\to\infty.\] 
Therefore the intersection 
\[\bigcap_n\gamma_n\]
contains a single point; denote it by $p_\infty$.

Let $\sigma_\infty$ be the incircle at $p_\infty$; it has to touch $\gamma$ at another point, say $q_\infty$.
The same argument as above shows that $q_\infty\in\gamma_n$ for any $n$.
It follows that $q_\infty =p_\infty$ --- a contradiction.

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{20 mm}

\end{wrapfigure}

Recall that a vertex of a smooth regular curve is defined as a critical point of its signed curvature;
in particular, any local minimum (or maximum) of the signed curvature is a vertex.
For example, every point of a circle is a vertex.

\begin{thm}{Four-vertex theorem}\label{thm:4-vert}
Any smooth regular simple plane curve has at least four
vertices.
\end{thm}

}

Evidently any closed smooth regular curve has at least two vertices --- where the minimum and the maximum of the curvature are attained.
On the diagram the vertices are marked;
the first curve has one self-intersection and exactly two vertices;
the second curve has exactly four vertices and no self-intersections.

The four-vertex theorem was first proved by Syamadas Mukhopadhyaya \cite{mukhopadhyaya} for convex curves.
Many different proofs and generalizations are known.
One of our favorite proofs was given by Robert Osserman \cite{osserman}.
We give a proof  of the following stronger statement  based on the key lemma in the previous section.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:4-vert-supporting}
Any smooth regular simple plane curve is globally supported by its osculating circle at least at 4 distinct points;
two from inside and two from outside.
\end{thm}

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{33 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-63}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:4-vert} modulo \ref{thm:4-vert-supporting}.}
First note that if an osculating circline $\sigma$ at a point $p$ supports $\gamma$ locally, then $p$ is a vertex.
Indeed, if not, then a small arc around $p$ has monotonic curvature.

Applying the spiral lemma (\ref{lem:spiral}) we get that the osculating circles at this arc are nested.
In particular the curve $\gamma$ crosses $\sigma$ at $p$ and therefore $\sigma$ does not locally support $\gamma$ at $p$.
\qeds

}

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:4-vert-supporting}.}
According to the key lemma (\ref{thm:moon}), there is a point $p\in\gamma$ such that its osculating circle supports $\gamma$ from inside.
The curve $\gamma$ can be considered as a loop with the base at $p$.
Therefore the key lemma implies the existence of another point $q\in\gamma$ with the same property.

It shows the existence of two osculating circles that support $\gamma$ from inside;
it remains to show existence of two osculating circles that support $\gamma$ from outside.

In order to get the osculating circles supporting $\gamma$ from outside, one can repeat the proof of key lemma taking instead of incircle the circline of maximal signed curvature that supports the curve from outside, assuming that $\gamma$ is oriented so that the region on the left from it is bounded.%

(Alternatively, if one applies to $\gamma$ an inversion with respect to a circle whose center lies inside~$\gamma$, then the obtained curve $\gamma_1$ also has  two osculating circles that support $\gamma_1$ from inside.
According to \ref{ex:inverse}, these osculating circlines are inverses of the osculating circlines of $\gamma$.
Note that the region lying inside of $\gamma$ is mapped to the region outside of $\gamma_1$ and the other way around.
Therefore these two circlines correspond to the osculating circlines supporting $\gamma$ from outside.)
