\section{Simple curves}

In the following definition we use the notion of {}\emph{metric space} which is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:metric-spcaes}.
The Euclidean plane and space are the main examples of metric spaces that one should keep in mind.

Recall that a \index{real interval}\emph{real interval} is a connected subset of the real numbers.

Recall that a bijective continuous map $f\:X\to Y$ between subsets of some metric spaces is called a {}\emph{homeomorphism} if its inverse $f^{-1}\:Y\z\to X$ is continuous.  

\begin{thm}{Definition} 
A connected subset $\gamma$ in a metric space is called a \index{simple curve}\emph{simple curve} if it is {}\emph{locally} homeomorphic to a real interval.
\end{thm}

It turns out that any simple curve $\gamma$ can be \index{parametrization}\emph{parametrized} by a real interval or the circle.
That is, there is a homeomorphism $\GG\to\gamma$ 
where $\GG$ is a real interval (open, closed or semi-open) or the circle
\[\mathbb{S}^1=\set{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2}{x^2+y^2=1}.\] 
A complete proof of the latter statement is given by David Gale \cite{gale}.
The proof is not hard, but it would take us away from the main subject.
A~finickity reader may add this property in the definition of curve.

If $\GG$ is an open interval or a circle, we say that $\gamma$ is a \index{endpoint}\emph{curve without endpoints}, otherwise it is 
called a {}\emph{curve with endpoints}.
In the case when $\GG$ is a circle we say that the curve is \index{closed!curve}\emph{closed}. 
When $\GG$ is a closed interval, $\gamma$ is called a {}\emph{simple arc}.


A parametrization $\GG\to\gamma$ describes a curve completely.
We will denote a curve and its parametrization by the same letter;
for example, we may say a plane curve $\gamma$ is given with a parametrization $\gamma\:(a,b)\z\to \mathbb{R}^2$.
Note, however, that any simple curve admits many different parametrizations. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:9}

\begin{subthm}{ex:9:compact}
Show that the image of any continuous injective map $\gamma\:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^2$ is a simple arc.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:9:9}
Find a continuous injective map $\gamma\:(0,1)\to\mathbb{R}^2$ such that its image is not a simple curve.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}


\section{Parametrized curves}

A \index{parametrized curve}\emph{parametrized curve} is defined as a continuous map $\gamma\:\GG\to\spc{X}$ from a circle or a real interval (open, closed or semi-open) $\GG$ to a metric space $\spc{X}$. 
For a parametrized curve we do not assume that $\gamma$ is injective; in other words, a parametrized curve might have \index{self-intersections}\emph{self-intersections}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{15 mm}
\vskip-3mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-130}
\end{wrapfigure}

If we say \index{curve}\emph{curve} it means we do not want to specify whether it is a parametrized curve or a simple curve.

If the domain of a parametrized curve is a closed interval $[a,b]$, then the curve is called an \index{arc}\emph{arc}.
Further, if it is the unit interval $[0,1]$, then it is also called a \index{path}\emph{path}.
If in addition $p=\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)$, then $\gamma$ is called a \index{loop}\emph{loop};
in this case the point $p$ is called the \index{base of loop}\emph{base} of the loop.

Suppose $\GG_1$ and $\GG_2$ are either real intervals or circles.
A continuous onto map $\tau\:\GG_1\to\GG_2$ is called \index{monotone map}\emph{monotone} if for any $t\in \GG_2$ the set $\tau^{-1}\{t\}$ is connected.
Note that if $\GG_1$ and $\GG_2$ are intervals, then, by the intermediate value theorem, a monotone map is either nondecreaing or nonincreasing;
that is, our definition agrees with the standard one when $ \GG_1 $ and $\GG_2$ are intervals.

Suppose that $\gamma_1\:\GG_1\to \spc{X}$ and $\gamma_2\:\GG_2\to \spc{X}$ are two parametrized curves such that 
$\gamma_1=\gamma_2\circ\tau$ for a monotone map $\tau\:\GG_1\to\GG_2$.
Then we say that $\gamma_2$ is \index{reparametrization}\emph{reparametrization}%
\footnote{Note that in general, $\gamma_1$ is {}\emph{not} a reparametrization of $\gamma_2$.
In other words, according to our definition, the described relation {}\emph{being a reparametrization} is not symmetric;
in particular it is not an equivalence relation.
Usually it is fixed by extending it to the minimal equivalence relation that includes ours \cite[2.5.1]{burago-burago-ivanov}.
But we will stick to our version.}
of $\gamma_1$ by $\tau$.


\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{aex:simple-curve}
Let $X$ be a subset of the plane.
Suppose that two distinct points $p,q\in X$ can be connected by a path in $X$.
Show that there is a simple arc in~$X$ connecting $p$ to $q$.
\end{thm}

\section{Smooth curves}

Curves in the Euclidean space or plane are called \index{space curve}\emph{space curves} or, respectively, \index{plane curve}\emph{plane curves}.

A parametrized space curve can be described by its coordinate functions 
\[\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t)).\]
Plane curves can be considered as a special case of space curves with $z(t)\equiv 0$.

Recall that a real-to-real function is called \index{smooth!function}\emph{smooth} if its derivatives of all orders are defined everywhere in the domain of definition.  
If each of the coordinate functions $x(t), y(t)$ and $z(t)$ of a space curve $\gamma$ are smooth, then the parametrized curve is called \index{smooth!curve}\emph{smooth}.

If the \index{velocity vector}\emph{velocity vector} 
\[\gamma'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t),z'(t))\] 
does not vanish at any point, then the parametrized curve $\gamma$ is called \index{regular!curve}\emph{regular}.

A simple space curve is called \index{smooth!curve}\emph{smooth} (respectively, {}\emph{regular}) if it admits a smooth (respectively, regular) parametrization.
Regular smooth curves are among the main objects in differential geometry;
colloquially, the term \index{smooth!curve}\emph{smooth curve} is often used as a shortcut for {}\emph{smooth regular curves}. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:L-shape}
Recall that (see Section \ref{sec:analysis}) that the following function is smooth: 
\[f(t)=
\begin{cases}
0&\text{if}\ t\le 0,
\\
\frac{t}{e^{1\!/\!t}}&\text{if}\ t> 0.
\end{cases}
\]

Show that $\alpha(t)=(f(t),f(-t))$ gives a smooth parametrization of a simple curve formed by the union of two half-axis in the plane.

Show that any smooth parametrization of this curve has a vanishing velocity vector at the origin.
Conclude that this curve is not regular;
that is, it does not admit a regular smooth parametrization.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:cycloid}
Describe the set of real numbers $\ell$
such that the plane curve $\gamma_\ell (t)= (t+\ell \cdot \sin t,\ell \cdot \cos t)$, $t\in\mathbb{R}$ is

\begin{minipage}{.30\textwidth}
\begin{subthm}{ex:cycloid:smooth}
smooth; 
\end{subthm}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.30\textwidth}
\begin{subthm}{ex:cycloid:regular}
regular;

\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{.30\textwidth}
\begin{subthm}{ex:cycloid:simple}
simple.
\end{subthm}
\end{minipage}

\end{thm}

\section{Periodic parametrizations}

Any smooth regular closed curve can be described by a {}\emph{periodic} parametrized curve $\gamma\: \mathbb{R}\to \spc{X}$; that is, a curve such that $\gamma(t+\ell)=\gamma(t)$ for a fixed period $\ell > 0$ and all $t$.
For example, the unit circle in the plane can be described by the $2{\cdot}\pi$-periodic parametrization $\gamma(t)=(\cos t,\sin t)$.

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{17 mm}
\vskip-2mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-51}
\end{wrapfigure}

Any smooth regular closed curve can be also described by a smooth regular loop.
But in general the closed curve described by a smooth regular loop might fail to be regular at its base; an example is shown on the diagram.

}

\section{Implicitly defined curves}\label{sec:implicit-curves}

Suppose $f\:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function; 
that is, all its partial derivatives are defined everywhere.
Let $\gamma\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the set of solutions of the equation $f(x,y)=0$.

Assume $\gamma$ is connected.
According to the implicit function theorem (\ref{thm:imlicit}), the set $\gamma$ is a smooth regular simple curve if $0$ is a \index{regular!value}\emph{regular!value} of~$f$; that is, the gradient $\nabla_p f$ does not vanish at any point $p\in \gamma$.
In other words, if $f(p)=0$, then   
$f_x(p)\ne 0$ or $f_y(p)\ne 0$.%
\footnote{Here $f_x$ is a shortcut notation for the partial derivative
$\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}$.\index{10f@$f_x$}}

The described condition is sufficient but {}\emph{not necessary}.
For example, zero is not a regular value the function $f(x,y)=y^2$, but the equation $f(x,y)=0$ describes a smooth regular curve --- the $x$-axis.


Similarly, assume $f,h$ is a pair of smooth functions defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
The system of equations
\[\begin{cases}
   f(x,y,z)=0,
   \\
   h(x,y,z)=0.
  \end{cases}
\]
defines a regular smooth space curve if the set $\gamma$ of solutions is connected and $0$ is a regular value of the map $F\:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^2$ defined as
\[F\:(x,y,z)\mapsto (f(x,y,z),h(x,y,z)).\]
It means that the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla h$ are linearly independent at any point $p\in \gamma$.
In other words, the Jacobian matrix
\[
\Jac_pF=\begin{pmatrix}
f_x&f_y&f_z\\
h_x&h_y&h_z
\end{pmatrix}
\]
for the map $F\:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^2$ has rank 2 at any point $p \in \gamma$.

If a curve $\gamma$ is described in such a way,
then we say that it is \index{implicitly defined curve}\emph{implicitly defined}.
If a curve is defined by its parametrization, we say that it is \index{explicitly defined curve}\emph{explicitly defined}.

The implicit function theorem guarantees the existence of regular smooth parametrizations for any implicitly defined curve.
However, when it comes to calculations, it is usually easier to work directly with implicit representations. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:y^2=x^3}
Consider the set in the plane described by the equation
$y^2=x^3$.
Is it a simple curve?
Is it a smooth regular curve?
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:viviani}
Describe the set of real numbers $\ell$
such that the system of equations
\[\begin{cases}
x^2+y^2+z^2&=1
\\
x^2+\ell\cdot x+y^2&=0
\end{cases}\]
describes a smooth regular curve.
\end{thm}

\section{Proper curves}\label{sec:proper-curves}

A parametrized curve $\gamma$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ is called \index{proper!curve}\emph{proper} if for any compact set $K \subset \spc{X}$, the inverse image $\gamma^{-1}(K)$ is compact.

For example, the curve $\gamma(t)=(e^t,0,0)$ defined on the real line is not proper.
Indeed, the half-line $(-\infty,0]$ is not compact, but it is the inverse image of the closed unit ball around the origin.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:open-curve}
Suppose $\gamma\:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2$ is a proper curve.
Show that  $|\gamma(t)|\z\to\infty$ as $t\to\pm\infty$.
\end{thm}


Recall that a closed interval is compact (\ref{thm:Heine--Borel}) and closed subsets of a compact set are compact;
see Section~\ref{sec:topology}.
It follows that closed curves and arcs are automatically proper;
indeed, their parameter sets are compact.

A simple curve is called proper if it admits a proper parametrization.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:proper-closed}
Show that a simple space curve is proper if and only if its image is a closed set.

\end{thm}

A proper simple plane curve without endpoints is called \index{open!curve}\emph{open}.
The terms {}\emph{open curve} and {}\emph{closed curve} have nothing to do with open and closed sets.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:proper-curve}
Use the Jordan's theorem (\ref{thm:jordan}) to show that any simple open plane curve divides the plane in two connected components.  
\end{thm}
