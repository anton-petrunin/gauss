\section{Definitions}


We say two smooth surfaces $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are \index{tangent!surfaces}\emph{tangent} at a point $p \in \Sigma_1 \cap \Sigma_2$ if they share the tangent plane at this point.
If the surfaces are oriented, we say they are \index{cooriented!surfaces}\emph{cooriented} if they have a common unit normal vector at $p$.
If their normal vectors at $p$ point in opposite directions, we say the surfaces are \index{counteroriented!surfaces}\emph{counteroriented}.

If there is a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $\Sigma_1\cap U$ lies on one side from $\Sigma_2$ in $U$, then we say that $\Sigma_2$ \index{local!support}\emph{locally supports} $\Sigma_1$ at~$p$.
If this happens, then $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ have to be tangent at $p$, and after adjusting the orientation of one of them, we can assume they are cooriented.

Now, suppose $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are cooriented at $p$.
Let us describe $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ locally at $p$ in tangent-normal coordinates as the graphs of functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ respectively.
$\Sigma_2$ locally supports $\Sigma_1$ at $p$ if and only if either
\[   f_1(x,y)\ge f_2(x,y)
\quad\text{or}\quad
f_1(x,y)\le f_2(x,y)\]
holds for all $(x,y)$ sufficiently close to the origin.
In the former case, we say  $\Sigma_2$ locally supports $\Sigma_1$ \index{supporting!surface}\emph{from the outside}, and in the latter we say $\Sigma_2$ locally supports $\Sigma_1$ \emph{from the inside}.



\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:surf-support}
Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be smooth oriented surfaces.
Assume $\Sigma_1$ locally supports $\Sigma_2$ from the inside at the point $p$ (equivalently $\Sigma_2$ locally supports $\Sigma_1$ from the outside).
Then 
\[k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\quad\text{and}\quad k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}\z\ge k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}.\]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:surf-support}
Construct two surfaces $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ that have a  common point $p$ with a common unit normal vector that
do not support each other, but
$k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\z> k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}$ and $k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}\z> k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}$.
\end{thm}


\parbf{Proof of \ref{prop:surf-support}.}
We can assume that $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are graphs $z=f_1(x,y)$  and $z=f_2(x,y)$ in common tangent-normal coordinates at $p$, so we have $f_1\ge f_2$.

Choose a common tangent unit vector ${\vec w}\in \T_p\Sigma_1=\T_p\Sigma_2$.
Consider the plane $\Pi$ passing thru $p$ and spanned by the normal vector $\Norm_p$ and ${\vec w}$.
Let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be the curves of intersection of $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ with $\Pi$.

Let us orient $\Pi$ so that the common normal vector $\Norm_p$ for both surfaces at $p$ points to the left from ${\vec w}$.
Further, let us parametrize both curves so that they are running in the direction of ${\vec w}$ at $p$ and are therefore cooriented.
In this case, the curve $\gamma_1$ supports the curve $\gamma_2$ from the right.

By \ref{prop:supporting-circline}, we have the following inequality for the normal curvatures of $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ at $p$ in the direction of ${\vec w}$:
\[k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_2}.\eqlbl{kw>=kw}\]

According to \ref{obs:k1-k2},
\[k_1(p)_{\Sigma_i}=\min_{\vec w}\set{k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_i}}{},\]
where $\vec w\in\T_p$ and $|\vec w|=1$.
Fix ${\vec w}$ such that 
\[k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\z=k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_1}.\]
By \ref{kw>=kw}, 
\begin{align*}

Similarly, by \ref{obs:k1-k2},
\[k_2(p)_{\Sigma_i}=\max_{\vec w}\set{k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_i}}{},\]
where $\vec w\in\T_p$ and $|\vec w|=1$.

\[k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}=k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_2}.\]
By \ref{kw>=kw},

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:surf-support}
Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be oriented smooth surfaces.
Assume $\Sigma_1$ locally supports $\Sigma_2$ from the inside at the point~$p$.
Then:

\begin{subthm}{cor:surf-support:mean}$H(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge H(p)_{\Sigma_2}$;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{cor:surf-support:gauss} If $k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\ge 0$, then $K(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge K(p)_{\Sigma_2}$.
\end{subthm}
 
\end{thm}

\parbf{Proof; \ref{SHORT.cor:surf-support:mean}.}
The statement follows from  \ref{prop:surf-support} since $H=k_1+k_2$.
%\[H(p)_{\Sigma_i}=k_1(p)_{\Sigma_i}+k_2(p)_{\Sigma_i}.\]


\parit{\ref{SHORT.cor:surf-support:gauss}.} Since $k_2(p)_{\Sigma_i}\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_i}$, and $k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\ge 0$, we get that all the principal curvatures 
$k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}$, 
$k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}$, 
$k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}$, and 
$k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}$ are nonnegative.
By \ref{prop:surf-support}, it implies that
\begin{align*}
K(p)_{\Sigma_1}&=k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\cdot k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge 
\\
&\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\cdot k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}=K(p)_{\Sigma_2}.

\section{Convex surfaces}

A surface that bounds a convex region is called \index{convex!surface}\emph{convex}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex-surf}
Show that the Gauss curvature of any convex smooth surface is nonnegative at each point.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:convex-lagunov}
Assume $R$ is a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^3$ bounded by a surface with principal curvatures at most~1.
Show that $R$ contains a unit ball.
\end{thm}

Recall that a region $R$ in the Euclidean space is called  {}\emph{strictly convex} if, for any two points $x,y\in R$, any point $z$ between $x$ and $y$ lies in the interior of~$R$.

For example, any open convex set is strictly convex.
The cube (as well as any convex polyhedron) gives an example of a non-strictly convex set.
Evidently, \textit{a closed convex region is strictly convex if and only if its boundary does not contain a line segment}.



\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:gauss+=>convexity}
Let $z=f(x,y)$ be the local description of a smooth surface $\Sigma$ in tangent-normal coordinates at a point $p\in\Sigma$.
Assume both principal curvatures of $\Sigma$ are positive at~$p$.
Then the function $f$ is strictly convex in a neighborhood of the origin and has a local minimum at the origin.

In particular, the tangent plane $\T_p$ locally supports $\Sigma$ from the outside at~$p$.
\end{thm}

\parbf{Proof.}
Since both principal curvatures are positive, by \ref{cor:Shape(ij)}, we have 
\[D^2_{\vec w}f(0,0)=\langle \Shape_p({\vec w}),{\vec w}\rangle\ge k_1(p)>0\] 
for any unit tangent vector ${\vec w}\in\T_p\Sigma$ (in our coordinates, ${\vec w}$ is horizontal).

By continuity of the function $(x,y,{\vec w})\mapsto D^2_{\vec w}f(x,y)$,
we have that $D^2_{\vec w}f(x,y)>0$ if $\vec w\ne 0$ and $(x,y)$ lies in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin.
This property implies that $f$ is a strictly convex function in a neighborhood of the origin in the $(x,y)$-plane (see \ref{thm:Jensen}).

Finally, since $\nabla f(0,0)=0$, and $f$ is strictly convex in a neighborhood of the origin, $f$ has a strict local minimum at the origin.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:section-of-convex}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface (without boundary) with positive Gauss curvature.
Show that any connected component of the intersection of $\Sigma$ with a plane is either a single point or a smooth plane curve whose signed curvature has constant sign.
\end{thm}

\section{Convexity test}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:convex-embedded}
Suppose $\Sigma$ is an open or closed smooth surface with positive Gauss curvature.
Then $\Sigma$ bounds a strictly convex region.
\end{thm}

In the proof we will have to use that the surface is connected (by the definition);
otherwise, a pair of spheres would give a counterexample.
It is true that \textit{any closed smooth surface with nonnegative Gauss curvature bounds a convex region}, but the proof requires more work \cite{hadamard,gomes,sacksteder}.

The same holds for surfaces with possible self-intersections.
This was proved by James Stoker \cite{stoker}, but he attributed the result to Jacques Hadamard who proved a closely relevant statement \cite[ยง 23]{hadamard}.

From the next proof, one can also extract the following statement: \textit{any closed connected locally convex region in the Euclidean space is convex}.

\parbf{Proof.}
Since the Gauss curvature is positive, we can assume that the principal curvatures are positive at any point.
Denote by $R$ the region bounded by $\Sigma$ that lies on the side of $\Norm$;
that is, $\Norm$ points inside $R$ at any point of~$\Sigma$.
(The region $R$ exists by \ref{clm:proper-divides}.)

Let us show that $R$ is {}\emph{locally strictly convex};
that is, for any point $p\in \Sigma$, the intersection of $R$ with a small ball centered at $p$ is strictly convex.

Indeed, suppose $z=f(x,y)$ is a local description of $\Sigma$ in the tangent-normal coordinates at~$p$.
By \ref{lem:gauss+=>convexity}, $f$ is strictly convex in a neighborhood of the origin.
In particular, the intersection of a small ball centered at $p$ with the epigraph $z\ge f(x,y)$ is strictly convex.

Since $\Sigma$ is connected, so is $R$;
moreover, any two points in the interior of $R$ can be connected by a polygonal line in the interior of~$R$.

Assume the interior of $R$ is not convex;
that is, there are points $x,y\in R$, and a point $z$ between $x$ and $y$ that does not lie in the interior of~$R$.
Consider a polygonal  line $\beta$ from $x$ to $y$ in the interior of~$R$.
Let $y_0$ be the first point on $\beta$ such that the chord $[x,y_0]$ touches $\Sigma$, say at~$z_0$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{43 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-37}
\vskip-0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Since $R$ is locally strictly convex, $R\z\cap B(z_0,\epsilon)$ is strictly convex for all sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$.
On the other hand, $z_0$ lies between two points in the intersection $[x,y_0]\cap B(z_0,\epsilon)$.
Since $[x,y_0]\subset R$, we arrived to a contradiction.

Therefore, the interior of $R$ is a convex set.
The region $R$ is the closure of its interior, therefore $R$ is convex as well.

Since $R$ is locally strictly convex, its boundary $\Sigma$ contains no line segments.
Therefore, $R$ is strictly convex.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:surrounds-disc}
Assume a closed surface $\Sigma$ surrounds a unit circle.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:small-gauss}
Let $\Sigma$ be a closed convex smooth surface of diameter at least $\pi$;
that is, there is a pair of points $p,q\in\Sigma$ such that $|p-q|\ge \pi$.
Show that $\Sigma$ has a point with Gauss curvature at most~1.
\end{thm}

\chapter{Saddle surfaces}

\section{Definitions}\label{sec:saddle}

A surface is called \index{saddle surface}\emph{saddle} if its Gauss curvature at each point is nonpositive;
in other words, the principal curvatures at each point have opposite signs or at least one of them is zero.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{43 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{asy/saddle}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

If the Gauss curvature is negative at each point,
then the surface is said to be {}\emph{strictly saddle};
equivalently, this means that the principal curvatures have opposite signs at each point.
In this case, the tangent plane cannot support the surface even locally --- moving along the surface in the principal directions at a given point, one goes above and below the tangent plane.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex-revolution}
Let $f\:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth positive function.
Show that the surface of revolution of the graph $y\z=f(x)$ around the $x$-axis
 is saddle if and only if $f$ is convex; that is, if $f''(x)\ge0$ for any~$x$.
\end{thm}

A surface $\Sigma$ is called \index{ruled surface}\emph{ruled} if, for every point $p\in \Sigma$, there is a line $\ell_p\subset \Sigma$ passing thru $p$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:ruled=>saddle}
Show that any ruled surface is saddle.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:saddle-convex}
Let $\Sigma$ be an open strictly saddle surface and $f\:\mathbb{R}^3\z\to\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth convex function.
Show that the restriction of $f$ to $\Sigma$ does not have a point of local maximum.
\end{thm}

A tangent direction on a smooth surface with vanishing normal curvature is called \index{asymptotic direction and line}\emph{asymptotic}.
A smooth curve that always runs in an asymptotic direction is called an
{}\emph{asymptotic line}.\label{page:asymptotic line}

Recall that a set $R$ in the plane is called \index{star-shaped}\emph{star-shaped} if there is a point $p\in R$ such that for any $x\in R$ the line segment $[p,x]$ belongs to~$R$.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:panov}
Let $\gamma$ be a closed smooth asymptotic line
in the graph $z\z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function~$f$.
Assume the graph is strictly saddle in a neighborhood of~$\gamma$.
Show that the region in the $(x,y)$-plane bounded by the projection $\bar \gamma$ of $\gamma$ cannot be star-shaped.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:crosss}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface and $p\in \Sigma$.
Assume $K(p)<0$.
Show that there is a neighborhood $\Omega$ of $p$ in $\Sigma$
such that the intersection of $\Omega$ with the tangent plane $\T_p$ is a union of two smooth curves  \index{transversality}\emph{intersecting transversally} at~$p$;
that is, their velocity vectors at $p$ are linearly independent.
\end{thm}


\section{Hats}

A \textit{closed surface cannot be saddle}.
Indeed, suppose $\Sigma$ is a closed surface.
Consider the smallest sphere that surrounds~$\Sigma$.
The sphere supports $\Sigma$ at some point, and at this point, the principal curvatures must have the same sign.
The following more general statement is proved using the same idea.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:convex-saddle}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a compact saddle surface, and its boundary line lies in a closed convex  region~$R$.
Then the entire surface $\Sigma$ lies in~$R$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Remark.}
In the case of strictly saddle surface, the lemma can be deduced from \ref{ex:saddle-convex}.

\parbf{Proof.}
Arguing by contradiction,
assume there is a point $p\in \Sigma$ that does not lie in~$R$.
Let $\Pi$ be a plane that separates $p$ from $R$; it exists by \ref{lem:separation}.
Denote by $\Sigma'$ the part of $\Sigma$ that lies with $p$ on the same side of~$\Pi$.

}

Since $\Sigma$ is compact, it is surrounded by a sphere;
let $\sigma$ be the circle of intersection of this sphere and $\Pi$.
Consider the smallest spherical dome $\Sigma_0$ with boundary $\sigma$ that surrounds~$\Sigma'$.

$\Sigma_0$ supports $\Sigma$ at some point~$q$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\Sigma_0$ and $\Sigma$ are cooriented at $q$, and $\Sigma_0$ has positive principal curvatures.
In this case, $\Sigma_0$ supports $\Sigma$ from the outside.
By \ref{cor:surf-support}, we have $K(q)_\Sigma\z\ge K(q)_{\Sigma_0}>0$, a contradiction.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:proper-saddle}
Construct a proper saddle surface that does not lie in the convex hull of its boundary line.
(By \ref{lem:convex-saddle} it cannot be compact.)
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:length-of-bry}
Let $\Delta$ be a compact smooth saddle surface with boundary and $p\in \Delta$.
Assume the boundary curve of $\Delta$ lies in the unit sphere centered at~$p$.
Show that if $\Delta$ is a topological disc, then $\length(\partial\Delta)\ge 2\cdot\pi$.

Show that the statement does not hold without assuming that $\Delta$ is a topological disc.
\end{thm}

\parit{Remark.}
In fact, $\area \Delta\ge \pi$;
that is, the unit plane disc has the minimal possible area.
This follows from the exercise by applying the so-called \index{coarea formula}\emph{coarea formula}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:circular-cone-saddle}
Show that an open saddle surface
cannot lie inside an infinite circular cone.
\end{thm}

A topological disc $\Delta$ in a surface $\Sigma$ is called a \index{hat}\emph{hat} of $\Sigma$
if its boundary line $\partial\Delta$ lies in a plane $\Pi$ and $\Delta \setminus \partial \Delta$ lies strictly on one side of $\Pi$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:hat}
A smooth surface $\Sigma$ is saddle if and only if it has no hats.
\end{thm}

A saddle surface can contain a closed plane curve.
For example, the hyperboloid $x^2+y^2-z^2=1$ contains the unit circle in the $(x,y)$-plane.
However, according to the proposition (as well as the lemma), a plane curve cannot bound a topological disc (as well as any compact set) in a saddle surface.

\parbf{Proof.}
Since a plane is convex, the only-if part follows from \ref{lem:convex-saddle};
it remains to prove the if part.

Assume $\Sigma$ is not saddle; that is, it has a point $p$ with strictly positive Gauss curvature;
or equivalently, the principal curvatures $k_1(p)$ and $k_2(p)$ have the same sign.
From now on we assume $0 < k_1 (p) \leq k_2 (p) $, the other case being analogous.


Let $z=f(x,y)$ be a graph representation of $\Sigma$ in tangent-normal coordinates at~$p$.
Consider the set $F_\epsilon$ in the $(x,y)$-plane defined by the inequality $f(x,y)\le \epsilon$.
By \ref{lem:gauss+=>convexity}, $f$ is convex in a small neighborhood of $(0,0)$.
Therefore, $F_\epsilon$ is convex, for sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$.
In particular, $F_\epsilon$ is a topological disc.

The map $(x,y)\mapsto (x,y,f(x,y))$ defines a homeomorphism from $F_\epsilon$
to
\[\Delta_\epsilon=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in \mathbb{R}^3}{f(x,y)\le \epsilon};\]
so $\Delta_\epsilon$ is a topological disc for any small $\epsilon>0$.
The boundary line of $\Delta_\epsilon$ lies on the plane $z=\epsilon$, and the entire disc lies below it;
that is, $\Delta_\epsilon$ is a hat of~$\Sigma$.
\qeds

The following exercise shows that $\Delta_\epsilon$ is in fact a smooth disc.
This can be used to prove a slightly stronger version of \ref{prop:hat};
namely in the definition of hats one can assume that the disc is smooth.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:disc-hat}
Let $f\:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth strictly convex function with a minimum at the origin.
Show that the set $F_\epsilon$ in the graph $z=f(x,y)$ defined by the inequality $f(x,y)\le \epsilon$ is a smooth disc for any $\epsilon>0$;
that is, there is a diffeomorphism 
$F_\epsilon$ to the unit disc $\Delta\z=\set{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2}{x^2+y^2\le 1}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:saddle-linear}

Show that for any saddle surface $\Sigma$ the image $L(\Sigma)$ is also a saddle surface.

\section{Saddle graphs}

The following theorem was proved by Sergei Bernstein \cite{bernstein}.
\index{Bernstein's theorem}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:bernshtein}
Let $f\:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function.
Assume its graph $z=f(x,y)$ is a strictly saddle surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Then $f$ is not bounded;
that is, there is no constant $C$ such that 
$|f(x,y)|\le C$ for any $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$.
\end{thm}

The theorem states that a saddle graph cannot lie between two horizontal planes;
combining this with \ref{ex:saddle-linear}, we get that saddle graphs cannot lie between two parallel planes.
The following exercise shows that the theorem does not hold for saddle surfaces that are not graphs.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:between-parallels}
Construct an open strictly saddle surface that lies between two parallel planes.
\end{thm}

Since $\exp(x-y^2)>0$,
the following exercise shows that there are strictly saddle graphs with functions bounded on one side;
that is, both (upper and lower) bounds are needed in the proof of the theorem.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:one-side-bernshtein}
Show that the graph
$z=\exp(x-y^2)$
is strictly saddle.
\end{thm}

The following exercise leads to a stronger version of Bernstein's theorem.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:saddle-graph}
Let $\Sigma$ be an open smooth strictly saddle surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Assume there is a compact subset $K\subset \Sigma$ such that the complement $\Sigma\setminus K$ is the graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function defined in an open domain of the $(x,y)$-plane.
Show that the surface $\Sigma$ is a graph.
\end{thm}

The following lemma gives an analogue of \ref{ex:length-of-bry}, and will be used in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:bernshtein}.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:region}
There is no proper strictly saddle smooth surface that has its boundary line in a plane $\Pi$ and lies at a bounded distance from a line contained in $\Pi$.
\end{thm}

\parbf{Proof.}
By \ref{ex:saddle-linear}, the statement can be reformulated in the following way:
\textit{There is no proper strictly saddle smooth surface 
with its boundary line in the $(x,y)$-plane
and contained in a region of the form:}
\[R=\set{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3}{0\le z\le r, 0\le y\le r}.\]

Assume the contrary, let $\Sigma$ be such a surface.
Consider the projection $\hat \Sigma$ of $\Sigma$ to the $(x,z)$-plane.
It lies in the upper half-plane and below the line $z=r$.

Consider the open upper half-plane $H=\set{(x,z)\in \mathbb{R}^2}{z> 0}$.
Let $\Theta$ be the connected component of the complement $H\setminus \hat \Sigma$ that contains all the points above the line $z=r$.

The set $\Theta$ is convex.
If not, then there is a line segment $[p,q]$ for some $p,q\in \Theta$ that cuts from $\hat\Sigma$ a compact piece.

\end{figure}
Consider the plane $\Pi$ thru $[p,q]$ that is perpendicular to the $(x,z)$-plane.
$\Pi$ cuts from $\Sigma$ a compact region $\Delta$.
By a general position argument (see \ref{lem:reg-section}),
we can assume that $\Delta$ is a compact surface with its boundary line in $\Pi$, and the remaining part of $\Delta$ lies strictly on one side from $\Pi$.
Since the plane $\Pi$ is convex, this statement contradicts \ref{lem:convex-saddle}.

Summarizing, $\Theta$ is an open convex set of $H$ that contains all points above $z=r$.
By convexity, together with any point $w$, the set $\Theta$ contains all points on the half-lines that start as $w$ and \textit{point up}; that is, in directions with positive $z$-coordinate.
In other words, with any point $w$,
the set $\Theta$ contains all points with larger $z$-coordinates.
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics{mppics/pic-75}

\end{figure}
Since $\Theta$ is open it can be described by an inequality $z>r_0$.
It follows that the plane $z=r_0$ supports $\Sigma$ at some point (in fact at many points).
By \ref{prop:surf-support}, the latter is impossible --- a contradiction.

%Note that the same proof goes through if one replaces the condition $0 \leq y \leq r$ in \ref{eq:R-bernstein} with $0 \leq y \leq h(x)$ for some positive continuous function $h$.

\parbf{Proof of \ref{thm:bernshtein}.}
Denote by $\Sigma$ the graph $z=f(x,y)$.
Assume the contrary; that is, $\Sigma$ lies between two planes $z=\pm C$.

The function $f$ cannot be constant.
It follows that the tangent plane $\T_p$ at some point $p\in\Sigma$ is not horizontal.

Denote by $\Sigma^+$ the part of $\Sigma$ that lies above $\T_p$.
Note that $\Sigma^+$ has at least two connected components which are approaching $p$ from both sides 
in the principal direction with positive principal curvature.
Otherwise, there is a curve that runs in $\Sigma^+$ and approaches $p$ from both sides.
This curve cuts a topological disc, say $\Delta$, from $\Sigma$ with the boundary line above or on $\T_p$ and some points strictly below $\T_p$;
the latter contradicts \ref{lem:convex-saddle}.
Summarizing, $\Sigma^+$ has at least two connected components.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics{mppics/pic-76}
\caption*{The surface $\Sigma$ seen from above.}

\end{figure}


Let $z=h(x,y)=a\cdot x+b\cdot y+c$ be the equation of $\T_p$.
Notice that $\Sigma^{+} = \set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in \Sigma}{h(x,y) \leq f(x,y)}$, hence it contains the connected set
\[R_-=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in\Sigma}{h(x,y)< -C}\] 
and is disjoint from  
\[R_+=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in\Sigma}{h(x,y)> C}.\]
Whence one of the connected components, say $\Sigma^+_0$, lies in the strip
\[R_0=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in\Sigma}{|h(x,y)|\le  C}.\]
This set lies at a bounded distance from the line of intersection of $\T_p$ with the $(x,y)$-plane.

Let us move $\T_p$ slightly upward and cut from $\Sigma^+_0$ the piece above the obtained plane, say $\bar\Sigma^+_0$.
By the general position argument (\ref{lem:reg-section}),
we can assume that $\bar\Sigma^+_0$ is a surface with a smooth boundary line;
by construction the boundary line lies in the plane.
The obtained surface $\bar\Sigma^+_0$ still lies at a bounded distance to a line.
The latter is impossible by \ref{lem:region}.

\section{Remarks}

Bernstein's theorem and the lemma in its proof do not hold for nonstrictly saddle surfaces;
counterexamples can be found among cylindrical surfaces over smooth curves; see the end of \ref{sec:shape}.
In fact, it can be shown that these are the only counterexamples;
a proof is based on the same idea, but it is more technical.

By \ref{prop:hat}, saddle surfaces can be defined as smooth surfaces without hats.
This definition can be used for arbitrary surfaces, not necessarily smooth.
Some results, for example, Bernstein's characterization of saddle graphs, can be extended to these generalized saddle surfaces.
However, this class of surfaces is far from being understood; see \cite[Chapter 4]{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin2019} and the references therein.
