This chapter contains computational proofs of several statements discussed above, including 
\begin{itemize}
\item Proposition~\ref{prop:inj-rad} --- an alternative definition of injectivity radius.

In addition, we discuss intrinsic isometries between surfaces and prove Gauss' remarkable theorem, stating that Gauss curvature can be defined intrinsically.

\section{Polar coordinates}

The property of the exponential map in \ref{prop:exp} can be used to define \index{polar coordinates}\emph{polar coordinates} in a smooth surface $\Sigma$ with respect to a point $p\in \Sigma$.

Namely, fix some polar coordinates $(r,\theta) \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0} \times \mathbb{S}^1  $ on the tangent plane $\T_p$.
If $\vec v\in \T_p$ has coordinates $(r,\theta)$,
then we say that $s(r,\theta)\z=\exp_p\vec v$ is the point in $\Sigma$ with  polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$.


Since there might be many geodesics from $p$ to a given point $x$,
the point $x$ might have many different polar coordinates.
However, according to Proposition~\ref{prop:exp} polar coordinates behave in  the usual way for small values of $r$.
More precisely, the following statement holds:

\begin{thm}{Observation}\label{obs:polar}
Let $(r,\theta)\mapsto s(r,\theta)$ describe polar coordinates with respect to a point $p$ in a  smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Then there is $r_0>0$ such that $s$ is  regular at any pair $(r,\theta)$ with $0<r<r_0$.

Moreover if $0\le r_1,r_2<r_0$, then $s(r_1,\theta_1) \z= s(r_2,\theta_2)$ if and only if
$r_1=r_2=0$ or $r_1=r_2$ and $\theta_1\z=\theta_2+2\cdot n\cdot\pi$ for an integer $n$.
\end{thm}

The following statement will play a key role in the formal proof that shortest paths are geodesics; see Section~\ref{sec:proof-of-gamma''}.

\begin{thm}{Gauss lemma}\label{lem:palar-perp}
Let $(r,\theta)\mapsto s(r,\theta)$ describe polar coordinates with respect to a point $p$ in a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Then
$s_\theta\perp s_r$
for any $r$ and~$\theta$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Choose $\theta$.
By the definition of exponential map, the curve $\gamma(t)\z=s(t,\theta)$ is a unit-speed geodesic that starts at $p$;
in particular, we have the following two identities:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Since the geodesic $\gamma$ has unit speed, we have $|s_r|=|\gamma'|=1$.
In particular,
 \[
 \tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
 \langle s_r,s_r\rangle=0\]
\item Since $\gamma$ is a geodesic, we have $s_{rr}(r,\theta)=\gamma''(r)\perp\T_{\gamma(r)}$ and therefore 
\[
\langle s_\theta, s_{rr}\rangle=0\]
\end{enumerate}
It follows that
\[
\begin{aligned}
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial r}
\langle s_\theta, s_r\rangle
&=
\langle s_{\theta r},s_r\rangle
+
\cancel{\langle s_\theta,s_{rr}\rangle}=
\\
&=
\tfrac12
\cdot 
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
\langle s_r, s_r\rangle=
\\
&=0.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:<s',s'>'=0}
\]
Therefore, for fixed $\theta$, the value 
$\langle  s_\theta, s_r\rangle$ does not depend on $r$.

Note that $s(0,\theta)=p$ for any $\theta$.
Therefore
$s_\theta(0,\theta)=0$
and in particular 
\[\langle s_\theta, s_r\rangle=0\]
for $r=0$.
By \ref{eq:<s',s'>'=0} the same holds for any $r$.

\section{Shortest paths are geodesics}

\label{sec:proof-of-gamma''}

In this section we use the construction of polar coordinates and the Gauss lemma \ref{lem:palar-perp} to prove Proposition~\ref{prop:gamma''}.

\parit{Proof of \ref{prop:gamma''}.}
Let $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to\Sigma$ be a shortest path parametrized by arc-length.
Suppose $\ell=\length\gamma$ is sufficiently small, so $\gamma$ can be described in the polar coordinates at $p$;
say as $\gamma(t)=s(r(t),\theta(t))$ for some functions $t\mapsto \theta(t)$ and $t\mapsto r(t)$ with $r(0)=0$.

Note that by the chain rule, we have
\[\gamma'= s_\theta\cdot \theta'+ s_r\cdot r'
\eqlbl{eq:chain(gamma)}\]
whenever the left side is defined.
By the Gauss lemma \ref{lem:palar-perp}, $s_\theta\perp s_r$ and by definition of polar coordinates $|s_r|=1$.
Therefore \ref{eq:chain(gamma)} implies
\[|\gamma'(t)|\ge r'(t).\eqlbl{eq:|gamma'|=r'}\]
for any $t$ where $\gamma'(t)$ is defined.

Since $\gamma$ parametrized by arc-length, we have 
\[|\gamma(t_2)-\gamma(t_1)|\le |t_2-t_1|.\]
In particular, $\gamma$ is Lipschitz.
Therefore by Rademacher's theorem (\ref{thm:rademacher}) the derivative $\gamma'$ is defined almost everywhere.
By~\ref{adex:integral-length:a}, we have that
\begin{align*}
\length\gamma&=\int_0^\ell|\gamma'(t)|\cdot dt\ge
\\
&\ge\int_0^\ell r'(t)\cdot dt=
\\
&=r(\ell).
\end{align*}

Note that by the definition of polar coordinates, there is a geodesic of length $r(\ell)$ from $p=\gamma(0)$ to $q=\gamma(\ell)$.
Since $\gamma$ is a shortest path, we get that $r(\ell)=\ell$ and moreover $r(t)=t$ for any $t$.
This equality holds if and only if we have equality in \ref{eq:|gamma'|=r'} for almost all $t$.
The latter implies that $\gamma$ is a geodesic.

It remains to prove the partial converse.

Fix a point $p\in\Sigma$.
Let $\epsilon>0$ be as in \ref{prop:exp}.
Assume a geodesic $\gamma$ of length less than $\epsilon$ from $p$ to $q$ does not minimize the length between its endpoints.
Then there is a shortest path from $p$ to $q$, which becomes a geodesic when it is parametrized by its arc-length.
That is, there are two geodesics from $p$ to $q$ of length smaller than $\epsilon$.
In other words there are two vectors ${\vec v},\vec w\in\T_p$ such that $|{\vec v}|<\epsilon$, $|\vec w|<\epsilon$ and 
$q=\exp_p\vec v\z=\exp_p\vec w$.
But according to \ref{prop:exp}, the exponential map $\T_p \to \Sigma$ is injective in the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of zero --- a contradiction.\qeds

\section{Gauss curvature}

Let $s$ be a smooth map from a (possibly unbounded) coordinate rectangle in the $(u,v)$-plane to a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
The map $s$ is called \index{semigeodesic}\emph{semigeodesic} if for any fixed $v$ the map $u\mapsto s(u,v)$ is a unit-speed geodesic and $s_u\perp s_v$ for any $(u,v)$.

Note that according to the Gauss lemma (\ref{lem:palar-perp}), the polar coordinates on $\Sigma$ are described by a semigeodesic map.

Note that we can choose a unit vector field~$\Norm=\Norm(u,v)$ that is normal to $\Sigma$ at the point $s(u,v)$.
For each pair $(u,v)$, consider an orthonormal frame $\Norm$, $\vec u=s_u$ and $\vec v=\Norm\times \vec u$.
Recall that  since the vector $s_v(u,v)$ is tangent to $\Sigma$ at $s(u,v)$, $s_v\perp \vec u$ and $s_v\perp \Norm$. 
Therefore we have that $s_v=b\cdot\vec v$ for some smooth function $(u,v)\z\mapsto b(u,v)$.

(For a fixed value $v_0$, the vector field $s_v=b\cdot\vec v$ describes the difference between $\gamma_0$ and an {}\emph{infinitesimally close} geodesic $\gamma_1\:u\mapsto s(u,v_1)$.
The fields with this property are called \index{Jacobi field}\emph{Jacobi fields} along $\gamma_0$.)


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:jaccobi}
Suppose $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ is a semigeodesic map to a smooth surface $\Sigma$ and $\Norm$, $\vec u$, $\vec v$ and $b$ are as described above.
Then 
\[b\cdot K+b_{uu}=0.\]
where $K=K(u,v)$ is the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ at the point $s(u,v)$.

Moreover, 
\[
\langle\vec u_u,\vec u\rangle=
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle=
\langle\vec u_v,\vec u\rangle=0,
\quad\text{and}\quad
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v\rangle=b_u.
\]

\end{thm}

The proof is done by lengthy, but straightforward computations.

\parit{Proof.}
Suppose that $\ell=\ell(u,v)$, $m=m(u,v)$, and $n=n(u,v)$ be the components of the matrix describing the shape operator in the frame $\vec u, \vec v$;
that is,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Shape\vec u&=\ell\cdot \vec u+ m\cdot \vec v,
&
\Shape\vec v&=m\cdot \vec u+ n\cdot \vec v.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:Shape(u,v)}
\]
Recall that (see Section \ref{sec:More curvatures})
\[K=\ell\cdot n-m^2.\]

The following four identities are the key to the proof:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\vec u_u&=\ell\cdot \Norm,
&
\vec u_v&=\phantom{-}b_u\cdot \vec v+b\cdot m\cdot\Norm,
\\
\vec v_u&=m\cdot \Norm,
&
\vec v_v&=-b_u\cdot \vec u+b\cdot n\cdot\Norm.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:uu-vv}
\]

Suppose that the identities in \ref{eq:uu-vv} are proved already.
Then the proposition can be proved via the following calculations:
\begin{align*}
b\cdot K&=b\cdot (\ell\cdot n-m^2)=
\\
&=\langle\vec u_u,\vec v_v\rangle-\langle\vec u_v,\vec v_u\rangle=
\\
&= 
\left(
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle
-
\cancel{\langle\vec u_{uv},\vec v\rangle}
\right)-
\left(
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v\rangle
-
\cancel{\langle\vec u_{uv},\vec v\rangle}
\right)=
\\
&=-b_{uu}.
\end{align*}
It remains to prove the four identities in \ref{eq:uu-vv}.

\parit{Proof of $\vec u_u=\ell\cdot \Norm$.}
Since the frame $\Norm$, $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ is orthonormal, this vector identity can be rewritten as the following three scalar identities:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\langle\vec u_u,\vec u\rangle&=0,
&
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle&=0,
&
\langle\vec u_u,\Norm\rangle&=\ell.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:uu-vv:1}
\]
Since $u\mapsto s(u,v)$ is a geodesic we have that $\vec u_u=s_{uu}(u,v)\perp\T_{s(u,v)}$.
Hence the first two identities follow.

The remaining identity 
$\langle\vec u_u,\Norm\rangle=\ell$ follows from \ref{thm:shape-chart} and \ref{eq:Shape(u,v)}.
Indeed
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec u_u,\Norm\rangle
&=\langle s_{uu},\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \Shape s_u,s_u\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \Shape \vec u,\vec u\rangle=
\\
&=\ell.
\end{align*}

\parit{Proof of $\vec u_v=-b_u\cdot \vec v+b\cdot m\cdot\Norm$.}
This vector identity can be rewritten as the following three scalar identities:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\langle\vec u_v,\vec u\rangle&=0,
&
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v\rangle&=b_u,
&
\langle\vec u_v,\Norm\rangle&=b\cdot m.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:uu-vv:2}
\]

Since $\langle\vec u,\vec u\rangle=1$, we get 
$0=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}\langle\vec u,\vec u\rangle=2\cdot\langle\vec u_v,\vec u\rangle$; 
hence the first identity in \ref{eq:uu-vv:2} follows.

Further, since
\begin{align*}
\langle \vec v,\vec v\rangle=1,
\quad
0=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}\langle \vec v,\vec v\rangle=2\cdot\langle \vec v_u,\vec v\rangle,
\quad
\text{and}
\quad
s_v=b\cdot \vec v,
\end{align*}
we get
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v\rangle&=\langle s_{vu},\vec v\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \tfrac{\partial}{\partial u} (b\cdot\vec v),\vec v\rangle =
\\
&=b_u\cdot \langle \vec v,\vec v\rangle+b\cdot \langle \vec v_u,\vec v\rangle=
\\
&=b_u; 
\end{align*}
hence the first identity in \ref{eq:uu-vv:2} follows.

Finally, applying \ref{thm:shape-chart}, \ref{eq:Shape(u,v)}, and $s_v=b\cdot \vec v$, we get
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec u_v,\Norm\rangle
&=\langle s_{uv},\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \Shape s_u,s_v\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \Shape \vec u,b\cdot \vec v\rangle=
\\
&=b\cdot m.
\end{align*}

\parit{Proof of $\vec v_u=m\cdot \Norm$ and $\vec v_v=-b_u\cdot \vec u+b\cdot n\cdot\Norm$.}
Recall that $\vec v=\Norm\times \vec u$.
Therefore
\[\begin{aligned}
\vec v_u&=\Norm_u\times \vec u+\Norm\times \vec u_u,
&
\vec v_v&=\Norm_v\times \vec u+\Norm\times \vec u_v,
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:uu-vv:3+4}
\]
Expressions for $\vec u_u$ and $\vec u_v$ in \ref{eq:uu-vv} are proved already.
Further
\begin{align*}
-\Norm_u&=\Shape s_u=
&
-\Norm_v&=\Shape s_v=
\\
&=\Shape \vec u=
&
&=b\cdot\Shape \vec v=
\\
&=\ell\cdot\vec u+m\cdot\vec v,
&
&=b\cdot(m\cdot \vec u+ n\cdot \vec v),
\end{align*}
It remains to plug these four expressions in \ref{eq:uu-vv:3+4}.

A chart $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ is called \index{semigeodesic}\emph{semigeodesic} if the map $(u,v)\z\mapsto s(u,v)$ is semigeodesic.
Note that the function $b=b(u,v)$ for a semigeodesic chart $s$ has constant sign.
Therefore, by changing the sign of $\Norm$, we can (and always will) assume that $b>0$;
in other words, $b=|s_v|$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:semigeodesc-chart}
Show that any point $p$ in a smooth surface $\Sigma$ can be covered by a semigeodesic chart.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:inj-rad}
Let $p$ be a point on a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Assume that $\exp_p$ is injective in the ball $B=B(0,r_0)_{\T_p}$.
Suppose the semigeodesic map $(r,\theta)\mapsto s(r,\theta)$ describes polar coordinates with respect to $p$ and the function $(r,\theta)\mapsto b(r,\theta)$ is as above.

Prove the following statements:

\begin{subthm}{ex:inj-rad:sign}
$b(r,\theta)$ does not change sign for $0\z\le r\z<r_0$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:inj-rad:0}

Apply \ref{SHORT.ex:inj-rad:sign} and \ref{SHORT.ex:inj-rad:0} to prove \ref{prop:inj-rad}.

\end{thm}



A chart $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ is called \index{orthogonal chart}\emph{orthogonal} if $s_u\perp s_v$ for any $(u,v)$.
Note that any semigeodesic chart is orthogonal.

A solution of the following exercise is very similar to \ref{prop:jaccobi}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{lem:K(orthogonal)}
Let $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ be an orthogonal chart of a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Denote by $K=K(u,v)$ the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ at $s(u,v)$.
Set 
\begin{align*}
a=a(u,v)&\df|s_u|,&
b=b(u,v)&\df|s_v|,\\
\vec u=\vec u(u,v)&\df\tfrac{s_u}a,&
\vec v=\vec v(u,v)&\df\tfrac{s_v}b.
\end{align*}
Let $\Norm=\Norm(u,v)$ be the unit normal vector at $s(u,v)$.

\begin{subthm}{lem:K(orthogonal):uu-vv}
Show that 
\[

b\cdot m\cdot \Norm
,
&
\vec v_v
&=
-\tfrac1{a}\cdot b_u\cdot\vec u
+
b\cdot n\cdot \Norm,
\end{aligned}
\]
where $\ell=\ell(u,v)$, $m=m(u,v)$, and $n=n(u,v)$ be the components of the matrix describing the shape operator in the frame $\vec u, \vec v$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:K(orthogonal):K}
Show that
\[K=-\frac1{a\cdot b}\cdot

\end{subthm}
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:conformal}
Suppose that $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ is a \index{conformal chart}\emph{conformal chart};
that is, $s_u\perp s_v$ and $b=|s_u|=|s_v|$ for any $(u,v)$;
in this case the function $(u,v)\mapsto b(u,v)$ is called a \index{conformal factor}\emph{conformal factor} of $s$.

Use \ref{lem:K(orthogonal)} to show that the Gauss curvature can be expressed as 
\[K=-\frac{\triangle (\ln b)}{b^2},\]
where $\triangle$ denotes the \index{laplacian}\emph{laplacian}; that is, $\triangle=\tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial u^2}+\tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial v^2}$ and 
 $K=K(u,v)$ is the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ at $s(u,v)$.
\end{thm}

\section{Rotation of a vector field}

Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth oriented surface and $\gamma$ a simple closed path in~$\Sigma$.
Suppose that $\vec u$ is a field of unit tangent vectors to $\Sigma$ defined in a neighborhood of $\gamma$.
Denote by $\vec v$ the field obtained from $\vec u$ by a counterclockwise rotation by $\tfrac{\pi}2$ of the tangent plane at each point; it could also be defined as $\vec v=\Norm\times\vec u$.
Then the \index{rotation}\emph{rotation} of $\vec u$ around $\gamma$ is defined as the integral
\[\rot_\gamma\vec u
\df
\int_0^1\langle\vec u'(t),\vec v(t)\rangle\cdot dt.\]

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:rotation-parallel}
Suppose that $\gamma$ is a loop based at a point $p$ in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$ and $\vec u$ is a field of tangent unit vectors to $\Sigma$ defined in a neighborhood of $\gamma$.
Then the parallel transport $\iota_\gamma\:\T_p\to\T_p$ is a {}\emph{clockwise} rotation by the angle $\rot_\gamma\vec u$.

In particular rotations of different vector fields around $\gamma$ may only differ by a multiple of $2\cdot\pi$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
As above, set $\vec v=\Norm\times\vec u$. 
Denote by $\vec u(t)$ and $\vec v(t)$ the vectors at $\gamma(t)$ of the fields $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ respectively.

Let $t\mapsto \vec x(t)\in \T_{\gamma(t)}$ be the parallel vector field along $\gamma$ with  $\vec x(0)=\vec u(0)$.
Set $\vec y=\Norm\times\vec x$.

Note that there is a continuous function $t\mapsto \phi(t)$ such that 
$\vec u(t)$ is a counterclockwise rotation of $\vec x(0)$ by angle $\phi(t)$.
Since $\vec x(0)=\vec u(0)$, we can (and will) assume that $\phi(0)=0$.

Note that
\begin{align*}
\vec u&=\cos\phi\cdot \vec x+\sin\phi\cdot \vec y
\\
\vec v&=-\sin\phi\cdot \vec x+\cos\phi\cdot \vec y
\end{align*}
It follows that 
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec u',\vec v\rangle
=\phi'\cdot\biggl(&(\sin \phi)^2\cdot \langle\vec x,\vec x\rangle+(\cos \phi)^2\cdot \langle\vec y,\vec y\rangle
\biggr)=
\\
=\phi'.\ &
\end{align*}

Therefore
\begin{align*}
\rot_\gamma\vec u&=\int_0^1\langle\vec u'(t),\vec v(t)\rangle\cdot dt=
\\
&=\int_0^1\phi'(t)\cdot dt=
\\
&=\phi(1).
\end{align*}

Observe that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\iota_\gamma(\vec x(0))=\vec x(1)$,

\item  $\vec x (0) = \vec u (0) = \vec (1),$ 

\item $\vec u(1)$ is a counterclockwise rotation of $\vec x(1)$ by the angle $\phi(1)\z=\rot_\gamma\vec u$,

\item $\vec u(0)=\vec u(1)$.
\end{itemize}
It follows that $\vec x(1)$ is a {}\emph{clockwise} rotation of $\vec x(0)$ by angle $\rot_\gamma\vec u$, and the result follows.

The following lemma will play a key role in the proof of the Gauss--Bonnet formula given in the next section.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:rotation-semigeoesic}
Let $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ be a semigeodesic chart on a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Suppose that a simple loop $\gamma$ bounds a disc $\Delta$ that is covered completely by $s$.
Then 
\[\rot_\gamma\vec u+\iint_\Delta K=0,\]
where $\vec u=s_u$ and $K$ denote the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$.
\end{thm}

The proof is done by a calculation using the so-called \index{Green formula}\emph{Green formula} which can be formulated the following way:

Let $D$ be a compact region in the $(u,v)$-coordinate plane that is bounded by a piecewise smooth simple closed curve $\alpha$.
Suppose that $\alpha$ is oriented in such a way that $D$ lies on its left.
Then for any two smooth functions $P$ and $Q$ defined on $D$ we have
\[\iint_D (Q_u- P_v)\cdot du\cdot dv=\int_\alpha (P\cdot du+Q\cdot dv).\]

Note that Green and Gauss--Bonnet formulas are similar --- they relate the integral along a disc and its boundary curve.
So it shouldn't be  surprising that Green helps to prove Gauss--Bonnet.

\parit{Proof.}
Let us write $\gamma$ in the $(u,v)$-coordinates: $\gamma(t)=s(u(t),v(t))$. Set $\vec v=\tfrac{s_v}{b}$, note that $\vec v$ is a unit vector field orthogonal to $\vec u$ and we can assume that it is the counterclockwise rotation of $\vec u$ by the angle $\tfrac{\pi}2$.

Therefore
\begin{align*}
\rot_\gamma \vec u&=\int_0^1\langle\vec u',\vec v\rangle\cdot dt=
\intertext{by the chain rule}
&=\int_0^1[\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle\cdot u'+\langle\vec u_v,\vec v\rangle\cdot v']\cdot dt=
\intertext{by \ref{prop:jaccobi},}
&=\int_0^1b_u\cdot v'\cdot dt=
\\
&=\int_{s^{-1}\circ\gamma}b_u\cdot dv=
\intertext{by the Green formula}
&=\iint_{s^{-1}(R)}b_{uu}\cdot du\cdot dv=
\intertext{Since $\jac s=b$, we get}
&=\iint_R\frac{b_{uu}}{b}=
\intertext{by \ref{prop:jaccobi}, $K=-\tfrac{b_{uu}}{b}$, so we get}
&=-\iint_{R}K.
\end{align*}

\section{Gauss--Bonnet formula: a formal proof}\label{sec:gauss--bonnet:formal}

Recall that for a topological disc $\Delta$ in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$ we set
\[\GB(\Delta)=\tgc{\partial\Delta}+\iint_\Delta K-2\cdot \pi,\]
where we assume that $\partial \Delta$ is oriented in such a way that $\Delta$ lies on its left.
So the Gauss--Bonnet formula can be written as $\GB(\Delta)=0$.

\parit{Proof of the Gauss--Bonnet formula (\ref{thm:gb}).}
First assume that $\Delta$ is covered by a semigeodesic chart.
Note that the following weaker formula follows from \ref{prop:pt+tgc},
\ref{lem:rotation-parallel},
and \ref{lem:rotation-semigeoesic}:
\[\GB(\Delta)=2\cdot n\cdot \pi,
\eqlbl{eq:gb(n)}\]
where $n=n(\Delta)$ is an integer.

By \ref{ex:semigeodesc-chart}, any point can be covered by a semigeodesic chart.
Therefore applying \ref{lem:GB-sum} finite number of times, we get that 
\ref{eq:gb(n)} holds for any disc $\Delta$ in $\Sigma$.

Assume that $\Delta$ lies in a local graph realization $z=f(x,y)$ of~$\Sigma$.
Consider the one-parameter family $\Sigma_t$ of graphs $z=t\cdot f(x,y)$ and denote by $\Delta_t$ the corresponding disc in $\Sigma_t$, so $\Delta_1=\Delta$ and $\Delta_0$ is its projection to the $(x,y)$-plane.
Note that the function $f\:t\mapsto \GB(\Delta_t)$ is continuous.
From above, $f(t)$ is a multiple of $2\cdot\pi$ for any $t$.
It follows that $f$ is a constant function.
In particular 
\begin{align*}
\GB(\Delta)&=\GB(\Delta_0)=
\\
&=0,
\end{align*}
where the last equality follows from $\ref{prop:total-signed-curvature}$.

We proved that 
\[\GB(\Delta)=0\eqlbl{eq:GB=0}\]
if $\Delta$ lies in a graph $z=f(x,y)$ for some $(x,y,z)$-coordinate system.
Since  any point of $\Sigma$ has a neighborhood that can be covered by such a graph, applying Lemma~\ref{lem:GB-sum} as above we get that \ref{eq:GB=0} holds for any disc~$\Delta$ in~$\Sigma$.

\section{Rauch comparison}

The following proposition is a special case of the so-called \index{Rauch comparison theorem}\emph{Rauch comparison theorem}.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:rauch}
Suppose that $p$ is a point on a smooth surface $\Sigma$ and $r\le \inj(p)$.
Given a curve $\tilde\gamma$ in the $r$-neighborhood of $0$ in $\T_p$, set 
\[\gamma=\exp_p\circ\tilde\gamma
\quad
\text{or, equivalently}
\quad
\log_p\circ\gamma=\tilde\gamma
;\]
note that $\gamma$ is a curve in $\Sigma$.

\begin{subthm}{prop:rauch:K>=0}
If $\Sigma$ has nonnegative Gauss curvature, then the exponential map $\exp_p$ is length nonexpanding in the $r$-neighborhood of $0$ in $\T_p$;
that is, 
\[\length \gamma\le \length \tilde\gamma\]
for any curve $\tilde\gamma$ in the open ball $B(0,r)_{\T_p}$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{prop:rauch:K=<0}
If $\Sigma$ has nonpositive Gauss curvature, then the logarithmic map $\log_p$ is length nonexpanding in the $r$-neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$;
that is, 
\[\length \gamma\ge \length \tilde\gamma\]
for any curve $\gamma$ in the open ball $B(p,r)_{\Sigma}$.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Suppose $(r(t),\theta(t))$ are the polar coordinates of $\tilde\gamma(t)$.
Note that $\gamma(t)\z=s(r(t),\theta(t))$; that is, $(r(t),\theta(t))$ are the polar coordinates of $\gamma(t)$ with respect to $p$ on $\Sigma$.

Set $b(r,\theta)\df|s_\theta|$.
By \ref{prop:jaccobi}
\[b_{rr}=-K\cdot b.\]
If $K\ge 0$, then $r\mapsto b(r,\theta)$ is concave
and
if $K\le 0$, then $r\mapsto b(r,\theta)$ is convex for any fixed $\theta$.
Note that $b(0,\theta)=0$ and by \ref{obs:d(exp)=1}, $b_\theta(0,\theta)=1$.
Therefore 
\[
\begin{aligned}
b(r,\theta)\le r\quad\text{if}\quad K&\ge 0 \quad\text{and}
\\
b(r,\theta)\ge r\quad\text{if}\quad K&\le 0.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:b-K}
\]

Without loss of generality we may assume that $\tilde\gamma\:[a,b]\to \T_p$ is parametrized by arc-length;
in particular it is a Lipschitz curve.
Note that
\begin{align*}
\length\tilde\gamma&=\int_a^b\sqrt{r'(t)^2+r(t)^2\cdot\theta'(t)^2}.
\intertext{Applying \ref{lem:palar-perp}, we get}
\length\gamma&=\int_a^b\sqrt{r'(t)^2+b(r(t),\theta(t))^2\cdot\theta'(t)^2}.
\end{align*}
Both statements follow from \ref{eq:b-K}.

\section{Intrinsic isometries}

Let $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^{*}$ be two smooth regular surfaces in the Euclidean space.
A map $f\:\Sigma\to \Sigma^{*}$ is called  \index{length-preserving}\emph{length-preserving} if for any curve $\gamma$ in $\Sigma$ the curve $\gamma^{*}=f\circ\gamma$ in $\Sigma^{*}$ has the same length. 
If in addition $f$ is smooth and bijective, then it is called an  \index{intrinsic isometry}\emph{intrinsic isometry}. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:K=0}
Suppose that the Gauss curvature of a smooth surface $\Sigma$ vanishes.
Show that $\Sigma$ is \index{locally flat surface}\emph{locally flat};
that is, a neighborhood of any point in $\Sigma$ admits an intrinsic isometry to an open domain in the Euclidean plane.  
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:K=1}
Suppose that a smooth surface $\Sigma$ has unit Gauss curvature at every point.
Show that a neighborhood of any point in $\Sigma$ admits an intrinsic isometry to an open domain in the unit sphere.
\end{thm}

A simple example of intrinsic isometry can be obtained by wrapping a plane into a cylinder with the map $s\:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ given by 
\[s(x,y) = (\cos x ,\sin x, y).\]
The following exercise produces a more interesting example.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:deformation}
Given $a>0$, show that there is a smooth unit speed curve 
$\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ with $y(t) = a\cdot \cos t$ and $y>0$;
Describe its interval of definition.

Let $\Sigma_a$ be the surface of revolution of $\gamma$ around the $x$-axis.

\lbl[t]{73,8;$a=\tfrac12$}
\end{lpic}
\vskip-0mm
\end{figure}
Show that the surface $\Sigma_a$ has unit Gauss curvature at each point.

Use \ref{ex:K=1} to conclude that any small round disc $\Delta$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$ admits a smooth length-preserving deformation; that is, there is one-parameter family of surfaces with boundary $\Delta_t$, such that $\Delta_0=\Delta$ and $\Delta_t$ is not congruent to $\Delta_0$ for $t\ne0$.\footnote{In fact any disc in $\mathbb{S}^2$ admits a smooth length preserving deformation.
However if the disc is larger than half-sphere, then the proof requires more;
it can be obtained as a corollary of two deep results of Alexandr Alexandrov: the gluing theorem and the theorem on the existence of a convex surface with an abstractly given metric \cite[p. 44]{pogorelov}.
}
\end{thm}

\section{The remarkable theorem}


\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:remarkable}
Suppose $f\:\Sigma\to \Sigma^{*}$ is an intrinsic isometry between two smooth regular surfaces in  the Euclidean space; $p\in \Sigma$ and $p^{*}\z=f(p)\in \Sigma$.
Then 
\[K(p)_{\Sigma}=K(p^{*})_{\Sigma^{*}};\]
that is, the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ at $p$ is the same as the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma^{*}$ at $p^{*}$.
\end{thm}

This theorem was proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss \cite{gauss} who called it the \index{Remarkable theorem}\emph{Remarkable theorem} (\index{Theorema Egregium}\emph{Theorema Egregium}).
The theorem is indeed remarkable because the Gauss curvature is defined as a product of principal curvatures which might be different at these points; however, according to the theorem, their product cannot change.
In other words, the Gaussian curvature is an {}\emph{intrinsic invariant}.

In fact the Gauss curvature of the surface at the given point can be found {}\emph{intrinsically},
by measuring the lengths of curves in the surface.
For example, the Gauss curvature $K(p)$ appears in the following formula for the circumference $c(r)$ of a geodesic circle centered at $p$ in a surface: 
\[c(r)=2\cdot\pi\cdot r-\tfrac\pi3\cdot K(p)\cdot r^3+o(r^3).\]

The theorem implies for example that there is no smooth length-preserving map that sends an open region in the unit sphere to the plane.%
\footnote{There are plenty of non-smooth length-preserving maps from the sphere to the plane; see \cite{petrunin-yashinski} and the references therein.}
This follows since the Gauss curvature of the plane is zero and the unit sphere has Gauss curvature 1. 
In other words, there is no map of any region on Earth without distortion.

\parit{Proof.}
 Choose a chart $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ on $\Sigma$ and set
$s^{*} =f\circ s$.
Note that $s^{*}$ is a chart of $\Sigma^{*}$ and 
\begin{align*}
\langle s_u,s_u\rangle
&=
\langle s_u^{*}, s_u^{*}\rangle,
&
\langle s_u, s_v\rangle
&=
\langle s_u^{*}, s_v^{*}\rangle,
&
\langle s_v, s_v\rangle
&=
\langle s_v^{*}, s_v^{*}\rangle
\end{align*}
at any $(u,v)$.
Indeed the first and the third identity hold since otherwise $f$ would not preserve the lengths of the coordinate lines $\gamma\:t\mapsto s(t,v)$ or  $\gamma\:t\z\mapsto s(u,t)$.
Taking this into account, the second identity holds since otherwise $f$ would not preserve the lengths of the coordinate lines $\gamma\:t\z\mapsto s(t,c-t)$ for some constant~$c$.

It follows that if $s$ is a semigeodesic chart,
then so is $s^{*}$.
It remains to apply \ref{prop:jaccobi} and \ref{ex:semigeodesc-chart}.
