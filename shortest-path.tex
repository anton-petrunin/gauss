\section{Intrinsic geometry}

Geometry of surfaces is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic.
We say that something is \index{intrinsic}\emph{intrinsic} if it can be checked or measired within the surface;
for example, lengths of curves on the surface or angles between them.
Otherwise, if the definition of something essentially uses the ambient space, then this something is called \index{extrinsic}\emph{extrinsic};
examples include normal curvature.

The mean curvature, as well as the Gauss curvature, are defined via principal curvatures, which are extrinsic.
Later (\ref{thm:remarkable}) it will be shown that remarkably the Gauss curvature is intrinsic --- it can be calculated via measurements within the surface.
The mean curvature is not intrinsic; for example, the intrinsic geometry of the plane is not distinguishable from the intrinsic geometry of the graph $z\z=(x+y)^2$.
However, the mean curvature of the former vanishes at all points, while the mean curvature of the latter does not vanish, say at the origin.  

The following exercise should help you get in the right mood;
it might look like a tedious problem in calculus, but it actually is an amusing problem in geometry.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:lasso}
A cowboy stands at the bottom of a frictionless ice-mountain formed by a cone with a circular base with the angle of inclination~$\theta$.
He throws up his lasso which slips neatly over the tip of the cone, pulls it tight, and tries to climb.

What is the critical angle $\theta$ at which the cowboy cannot climb the ice-mountain?
\end{thm}

\section{Definition}

Let $p$ and $q$ be two points on a surface~$\Sigma$.
Recall that $\dist{p}{q}\Sigma$ denotes the induced length distance from $p$ to~$q$;
that is, the greatest lower bound of the lengths of paths in $\Sigma$ from $p$ to~$q$.


A path $\gamma$ from $p$ to $q$ in $\Sigma$ that minimizes the length is called a \index{shortest path}\emph{shortest path} from $p$ to~$q$.
The image of such a shortest path will be denoted by $[p,q]$ or $[p,q]_\Sigma$.\index{10aac@$[p,q]$, $[p,q]_\Sigma$ (shortest path)}
If we write $[p,q]_\Sigma$, we are assuming that such a shortest path exists, and we have chosen one of them.
In general, there might be no shortest path between two given points, and there might be many of them;
this is shown in the following two examples.

\parbf{Nonuniqueness.} There are plenty of shortest paths between the poles of a round sphere --- each meridian is a shortest path.
The latter follows from \ref{obs:S2-length}.

\parbf{Nonexistence.} Let $\Sigma$ be the $(x,y)$-plane with the origin removed.
Consider two points $p=(1,0,0)$ and $q=(-1,0,0)$ in~$\Sigma$.
Let us show that \textit{there is no shortest path from $p$ to $q$ in~$\Sigma$.}

Note that $\dist{p}{q}\Sigma=2$. 
Indeed, given $\epsilon\z>0$, consider the point $s_\epsilon=(0,\epsilon,0)$.
The polygonal path $ps_\epsilon q$ lies in $\Sigma$, and its length $2\cdot\sqrt{1+\epsilon^2}$ approaches $2$ as $\epsilon\to0$.
It follows that $\dist{p}{q}\Sigma\le 2$.
Since $\dist{p}{q}\Sigma\z\ge \dist{p}{q}{\mathbb{R}^3}=2$, we get $\dist{p}{q}\Sigma=2$.

It follows that a shortest path from $p$ to $q$, if it exists, must have length~2.
By the triangle inequality, any curve of length 2 from $p$ to $q$ must run along the line segment $[p,q]$;
in particular, it must pass thru the origin.
Since the origin does not lie in $\Sigma$, there is no shortest path from $p$ to $q$ in $\Sigma$. 


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:shortest-paths-exist}
Any two points in a proper smooth surface (possibly with boundary) can be joined by a shortest path. 
\end{thm}

\parbf{Proof.}
Choose two points $p$ and $q$ in a proper smooth surface~$\Sigma$.
Set $\ell=\dist{p}{q}\Sigma$.

Since $\Sigma$ is smooth, the points $p$ and $q$ can be joined by a piecewise smooth path in $\Sigma$.
Since any such path is rectifiable, $\ell$ has to be finite.

By the definition of induced length-metric (Section~\ref{sec:Length metric}),
there is a sequence of paths $\gamma_n$ from $p$ to $q$ in $\Sigma$ such that
\[\length\gamma_n\to \ell\quad\text{as}\quad n\to \infty.\]

Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\length\gamma_n<\ell+1$ for any $n$, and each $\gamma_n$ is parametrized proportional to its arc-length.
In particular, each path $\gamma_n\:[0,1]\to\Sigma$ is $(\ell+1)$-Lipschitz; 
that is,
\[|\gamma(t_0)-\gamma(t_1)|\le (\ell+1)\cdot|t_0-t_1|\]
for any $t_0,t_1\in[0,1]$.

The image of $\gamma_n$ lies in the closed ball $\bar B[p,\ell+1]$ for any~$n$.
It follows that the coordinate functions of all $\gamma_n$ are uniformly equicontinuous and uniformly bounded.
By the Arzel\'{a}--Ascoli theorem (\ref{lem:equicontinuous}),
 there is a convergent subsequence of $\gamma_n$, and its limit, say $\gamma_\infty\:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^3$, is continuous;
that is, $\gamma_\infty$ is a path.
Evidently, $\gamma_\infty$ runs from $p$ to $q$;
in particular
\[\length\gamma_\infty\ge \ell.\]
Since $\Sigma$ is a closed set, $\gamma_\infty$ lies in~$\Sigma$.

Since length is semicontinuous (\ref{thm:length-semicont}), we get $\length\gamma_\infty\le \ell$.
Therefore, $\length\gamma_\infty\z= \ell$; equivalently, $\gamma_\infty$ is a shortest path from $p$ to~$q$.

\section{Nearest-point projection}

The following statement belongs to convex geometry,
but we present its proof since it plays a significant role in the sequel.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:nearest-point-projection}
Let $R$ be a closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Then for every point $p\in\mathbb{R}^3$ there is a unique point $\bar p\in R$ that minimizes the distance to $R$;
that is, $|p-\bar p|\le |p-x|$ for any point $x\in R$.

Moreover, the map $p\mapsto \bar p$ is short;
that is,
\[|p-q|\ge|\bar p-\bar q| \eqlbl{eq:short-cpp}\]
for any pair of points $p,q\in \mathbb{R}^3$.
\end{thm}

The map $p\mapsto \bar p$ is called the \label{nearest-point projection}\index{nearest-point projection}\emph{nearest-point projection};
it maps the Euclidean space onto~$R$.
If $p\in R$, then $\bar p=p$.
In particular $\bar{\bar p}=\bar p$ for any point $p$.

\parbf{Proof.}
Fix a point $p$, and set 
\[\ell=\inf\set{|p-x|}{x\in R}.\]
Choose a sequence $x_n\in R$ such that $|p-x_n|\to \ell$ as $n\to\infty$.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that all the points $x_n$ lie in a ball of radius $\ell+1$ centered at~$p$.
Therefore, we can pass to a \index{partial limit}\emph{partial limit} $\bar p$ of $x_n$; that is, $\bar p$ is a limit of a subsequence of $x_n$.
Since $R$ is closed, $\bar p\in R$.
By construction 
\begin{align*}
|p-\bar p|&=\lim_{n\to\infty}|p-x_n|=\ell.
\end{align*}
Hence, the existence follows.

Assume there are two distinct points $\bar p, \bar p'\in R$ that minimize the distance to~$p$.
Since $R$ is convex, their midpoint $m=\tfrac12\cdot (\bar p+\bar p')$ lies in~$R$.
Since $|p-\bar p|\z=|p-\bar p'|=\ell$, the triangle $[p\bar p\bar p']$ is isosceles; therefore the triangle $[p\bar p m]$ has a right angle at~$m$.
Since a leg of a right triangle is shorter than its hypotenuse, we have $|p-m|<\ell$, a contradiction. 

It remains to prove \ref{eq:short-cpp}.
We can assume that $\bar p\ne\bar q$; otherwise, there is nothing to prove.

}

If $\measuredangle \hinge{\bar p}{p}{\bar q}< \tfrac\pi2$, then $\dist{p}{x}{}\z<\dist{p}{\bar p}{}$ for a point $x\in [\bar p,\bar q]$ close to $\bar p$.
Since $[\bar p,\bar q]\subset K$,
the latter is impossible.
{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{37 mm}

Therefore, $\measuredangle \hinge{\bar p}{p}{\bar q}\ge \tfrac\pi2$ or $p=\bar p$.
In both cases, the orthogonal projection of $p$ to the line $\bar p\bar q$ lies behind $\bar p$, or coincides with $\bar p$.
The same way we show that the orthogonal projection of $q$ to the line $\bar p\bar q$ lies behind $\bar q$, or coincides with~$\bar q$.
This implies that the orthogonal projection of the line segment $[p,q]$ contains $[\bar p,\bar q]$.
Whence \ref{eq:short-cpp} follows.

\section{Shortest paths on convex surfaces}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:shorts+convex}
Assume a surface $\Sigma$ bounds a closed convex region $R$, and $p,q\in \Sigma$.
Denote by $W$ the outer closed region of $\Sigma$;
in other words, $W$ is the union of $\Sigma$ and the complement of~$R$.
Then 
\[\length\gamma\ge \dist{p}{q}\Sigma\]
for any path $\gamma$ in $W$ from $p$ to~$q$.
Moreover, if  $\gamma$ does not lie in $\Sigma$, then the inequality is strict.
\end{thm}

\parbf{Proof.}
Let $\bar\gamma$ be the nearest-point projection of~$\gamma$ to $R$.
The projection $\bar\gamma$ lies in $\Sigma$ and connects $p$ to $q$; therefore, 
\[\length\bar\gamma\ge \dist{p}{q}\Sigma.\]

To prove the first statement, it remains to show that 
\[\length\gamma\ge\length\bar\gamma.\eqlbl{bar-gamma=<gamma}\]

Consider a polygonal line $\bar p_0\dots \bar p_n$ inscribed in $\bar\gamma$.
Let $p_0\dots p_n$ be the corresponding polygonal line inscribed in $\gamma$;
that is $p_i=\gamma(t_i)$ if $\bar p_i=\bar\gamma(t_i)$.
By \ref{lem:nearest-point-projection}, $|p_i-p_{i-1}|\z\ge|\bar p_i-\bar p_{i-1}|$ for any~$i$.
Therefore,
\[\length p_0\dots p_n\ge \length \bar p_0\dots \bar p_n.\]
Applying the definition of length, we get \ref{bar-gamma=<gamma}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{37 mm}

\includegraphics{mppics/pic-82}

\end{wrapfigure}

It remains to prove the second statement.
Suppose there is a point $w\z=\gamma(t_1)\notin\Sigma$;
note that $w\notin R$.
Then there is a plane $\Pi$ that cuts $w$ from~$\Sigma$; see \ref{lem:separation}).

The curve $\gamma$ must intersect $\Pi$ at two points: one point before $t_1$ and one after.
Let $a\z=\gamma(t_0)$ and $b=\gamma(t_2)$ be these points.
The arc of $\gamma$ from $a$ to $b$ is strictly longer that $|a-b|$;
indeed its length is at least $|a-w|+|w-b|$, and $|a-w|+|w-b|>|a-b|$ since $w\notin[a,b]$.

Remove from $\gamma$ the arc from $a$ to $b$, and replace it with the line segment $[a,b]$.
Denote the obtained curve by $\gamma_1$, then
\[\length\gamma>\length \gamma_1.\]

Since $\gamma_1$ runs in~$W$, we get
\[\length \gamma_1\ge \dist{p}{q}\Sigma.\]
Hence the second statement follows.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:length-dist-conv}
Suppose $\Sigma$ is an open or closed smooth surface with positive Gauss curvature, and $\Norm$ is the unit normal field on~$\Sigma$.
Show that 
\[\dist{p}{q}\Sigma\le 2\cdot \frac{|p-q|}{|\Norm(p)+\Norm(q)|}\]
for any two points $p,q\in \Sigma$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:hat-convex}
Suppose $\Sigma$ is a closed smooth surface that bounds a convex region $R$ 
in $\mathbb{R}^3$
and $\Pi$ is a plane that cuts a hat $\Delta$ from~$\Sigma$.
Assume the reflection of the interior of $\Delta$ across $\Pi$ lies in the interior of~$R$.
Show that $\Delta$ is \index{convex!set}\emph{convex} with respect to the intrinsic metric  of $\Sigma$;
that is, 
if both endpoints of a shortest path in $\Sigma$ 
lie in $\Delta$,
then the entire path lies in $\Delta$.
\end{thm}


Let us define the \index{intrinsic!diameter}\emph{intrinsic diameter} of a closed surface $\Sigma$ as the least upper bound of the lengths of shortest paths in the surface.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:intrinsic-diameter}

\begin{subthm}{} Show that the intrinsic diameter of $\Sigma$ cannot exceed $\pi$.

Show that the area of $\Sigma$ cannot exceed $4\cdot \pi$.
