\section{Formulation}

The following theorem was proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss \cite{gauss}
for geodesic triangles;
Pierre Bonnet and Jacques Binet independently 
generalized the statement for arbitrary curves.
\index{Gauss--Bonnet formula}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:gb}
Let $\Delta$ be a topological disc in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$ bounded by a simple piecewise smooth curve $\partial\Delta$.
Suppose $\partial \Delta$ is oriented so that $\Delta$ lies on its left.
Then 
\[\tgc{\partial\Delta}+\iint_\Delta K=2\cdot \pi,\eqlbl{eq:g-b}\]
where $K$ denotes the Gauss curvature of~$\Sigma$.
\end{thm}

In this chapter,
we give an informal proof of this formula in a leading special case.
A formal computational proof will be given in Section~\ref{sec:gauss--bonnet:formal}.

Before going into the proofs, we suggest solving the following exercises using the Gauss--Bonnet formula.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:1=geodesic-curvature}
Assume $\gamma$ is a simple closed curve with constant geodesic curvature $1$ in a smooth closed surface $\Sigma$ with positive Gauss curvature.
Show that 
 \[\length\gamma< 2\cdot\pi;\]
that is, $\gamma$ is shorter than the unit circle in the plane.  
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:geodesic-half}
Let $\gamma$ be a simple closed geodesic on a smooth closed surface $\Sigma$ with positive Gauss curvature.
Denote by $\Norm$ the spherical map on $\Sigma$.
Show that the curve $\alpha=\Norm\circ\gamma$ divides the sphere into two regions of equal area.
Conclude that $\length \alpha\ge 2\cdot\pi.$
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:closed-geodesic}
Let $\gamma$ be a closed geodesic with self-intersections on a smooth closed surface $\Sigma$ with positive Gauss curvature.
Suppose $R$ is one of the regions that $\gamma$ cuts from~$\Sigma$.
Show that 
\[\iint_R K\le 2\cdot\pi.\]

Conclude that any two closed geodesics on $\Sigma$ have a common point.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:self-intersections}
Let $\Sigma$ be a closed smooth surface with positive Gauss curvature. 
Suppose $\gamma$ is a closed geodesic in $\Sigma$.
Show that in a single coordinate chart $\gamma$ cannot look like one of the curves on the following diagrams.

The following exercise gives the optimal bound on the Lipschitz constant of a convex function that guarantees that its geodesics have no self-intersections;
compare to \ref{ex:ruf-bound-mountain}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:sqrt(3)}
Suppose $f\:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ is a $\sqrt{3}$-Lipschitz smooth convex function.
Show that any geodesic in the graph $z=f(x,y)$ has no self-intersections.
\end{thm}

A surface $\Sigma$ is called \index{simply-connected}\emph{simply-connected} if any simple closed curve in $\Sigma$ bounds a disc.
Equivalently any closed curve in $\Sigma$ can be continuously deformed into a \index{trivial curve}\emph{trivial curve}; that is, a curve that stands at one point all the time.

Observe that a plane and a sphere are examples of simply-connected surfaces, while the torus and the cylinder are not simply-connected.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:unique-geod}
Suppose $\Sigma$ is a simply-connected open surface with nonpositive Gauss curvature.

\begin{subthm}{ex:unique-geod:unique}
Show that any two points in $\Sigma$ are connected by a unique geodesic.
In particular, geodesics in $\Sigma$ do not have self-intersections. 
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:unique-geod:diffeomorphism}
Conclude that for any point $p\in \Sigma$,
the exponential map $\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism from the tangent plane $\T_p$ to~$\Sigma$.
In particular, $\Sigma$ is diffeomorphic to the plane.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\section{Additivity}

Let $\Delta$ be a topological disc in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$ bounded by a simple piecewise smooth curve $\partial \Delta$.
As before we suppose $\partial \Delta$ is oriented in such a way that $\Delta$ lies on its left.
Set \index{10gb@$\GB$}
\[\GB(\Delta)=\tgc{\partial\Delta}+\iint_\Delta K-2\cdot \pi,
\eqlbl{eq:GB}\]
where $K$ denotes the Gauss curvature of~$\Sigma$.
Here $\GB$ stands for Gauss--Bonnet;
our goal is to show that
\[\GB(\Delta)=0.\]

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:GB-sum}
Suppose the disc $\Delta$ is subdivided into two discs $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ by a curve $\delta$.
Then
\[
\GB(\Delta)=\GB(\Delta_1)+\GB(\Delta_2).
\]
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{r}{40 mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-1750}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Let us subdivide $\partial \Delta$ into two curves $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ that share endpoints with $\delta$, so that
 $\Delta_i$ is bounded by the arc $\gamma_i$  and~$\delta$ for $i=1,2.$

Denote by $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$, $\psi_1$, and $\psi_2$ the angles between $\delta$ and $\gamma_i$ marked on the diagram.
Suppose the arcs $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, and $\delta$ are oriented as on the diagram. 
Then
\begin{align*}
\tgc{\partial \Delta}&= \tgc{\gamma_1}-\tgc{\gamma_2}+(\pi-\phi_1-\phi_2)+(\pi-\psi_1-\psi_2),
\\
\tgc{\partial \Delta_1}&= \tgc{\gamma_1}-\tgc\delta+(\pi-\phi_1)+(\pi-\psi_1),
\\
\tgc{\partial \Delta_1}&= \tgc\delta-\tgc{\gamma_2}+(\pi-\phi_2)+(\pi-\psi_2),
\\
\iint_\Delta K&=\iint_{\Delta_1} K+\iint_{\Delta_2} K.
\end{align*}
It remains to plug in the results in the formulas for $\GB(\Delta)$, $\GB(\Delta_1)$, and $\GB(\Delta_2)$.

\section{Spherical case}

Note that if $\Sigma$ is a plane, then the Gauss curvature vanishes;
therefore the Gauss--Bonnet formula \ref{eq:g-b} can be written as 
\[\tgc{\partial\Delta}=2\cdot \pi,\]
and it follows from \ref{prop:total-signed-curvature}.
In other words, $\GB(\Delta)=0$ for any disc~$\Delta$ in the plane.

If $\Sigma$ is the unit sphere, then $K\equiv1$;
in this case, Theorem~\ref{thm:gb} can be formulated in the following way:

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:area-of-spher-polygon}
Let $P$ be a spherical polygon bounded by a simple closed broken geodesic $\partial P$.
Assume $\partial P$ is oriented such that $P$ lies on the left of $\partial P$.
Then 
\[\GB(P)=\tgc{\partial P}+\area P-2\cdot \pi=0.\]

Moreover, the same formula holds for any spherical region bounded by a piecewise smooth simple closed curve.
\end{thm}

This proposition will be used in the informal proof given below.

\parit{Sketch of proof.}
Suppose a spherical triangle $\Delta$ has angles 
$\alpha$, $\beta$, and~$\gamma$.
According to \ref{lem:area-spher-triangle},
\[\area\Delta=\alpha+\beta+\gamma-\pi.\]

Recall that $\partial\Delta$ is oriented so that $\Delta$ lies on its left. 
Then its oriented external angles are  $\pi-\alpha$, $\pi-\beta$, and $\pi-\gamma$.
Therefore,
\[\tgc{\partial\Delta}=3\cdot\pi-\alpha-\beta-\gamma.\]
It follows that $\tgc{\partial\Delta}+\area \Delta=2\cdot\pi$ or, equivalently, $\GB(\Delta)=0$.
 
Note that we can subdivide a given spherical polygon $P$ into triangles by dividing a polygon in two on each step.
By the additivity lemma (\ref{lem:GB-sum}), we get
\[\GB(P)=0\]
for any spherical polygon~$P$.

The second statement can be proved by approximation. One has to show that
one could approximate the total geodesic curvature of  
a piecewise smooth simple closed curve by  
the total geodesic curvature of inscribed broken geodesics.
We omit the proof of the latter statement,
but it goes along the same lines as \ref{ex:total-curvature=}.
\qeds


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:half-sphere-total-curvature}
Assume $\gamma$ is a simple piecewise smooth loop on $\mathbb{S}^2$ that divides its area into two equal parts.
Denote by $p$ the base point of~$\gamma$.
Show that the parallel transport $\iota_\gamma\:\T_p\mathbb{S}^2\to\T_p\mathbb{S}^2$ is the identity map.
\end{thm}



\section{Intuitive proof}

In this section, we prove a special case of the Gauss--Bonnet formula.
This case is leading --- the general case can be proved similarly, but one has to use the signed area counted with multiplicity.

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:gb} for open and closed surfaces with positive Gauss curvature.}
By \ref{cor:intK}, we have
\[\GB(\Delta)=\tgc{\partial\Delta}+\area[\Norm(\Delta)]-2\cdot \pi.
\eqlbl{eq:gb-area}\]

Choose a loop $\alpha$ that runs along $\partial\Delta$ so that $\Delta$ lies on the left from it; suppose that $p\in \partial\Delta$ is its base.
Consider the parallel translation $\iota_\alpha\:\T_p\to\T_p$ along $\alpha$.
According to \ref{prop:pt+tgc}, $\iota_\alpha$ is the clockwise rotation by angle $\tgc{\alpha}_\Sigma$.

Set $\beta=\Norm\circ\alpha$.
By \ref{obs:parallel=}, we have $\iota_\alpha=\iota_\beta$, where $\beta$ is considered as a curve in the unit sphere.

Note that $\iota_\beta$ is a clockwise rotation by angle $\tgc{\beta}_{\mathbb{S}^2}$.
By \ref{prop:area-of-spher-polygon} 
\[\GB(\Norm(\Delta))=\tgc{\beta}_{\mathbb{S}^2}+\area[\Norm(\Delta)]-2\cdot \pi=0.\]
Therefore, 
$\iota_\beta$ is a counterclockwise rotation by $\area[\Norm(\Delta)]$

Summarizing, the clockwise rotation by $\tgc{\alpha}_\Sigma$ is identical to a counterclockwise rotation by $\area[\Norm(\Delta)]$.
The rotations are identical if the angles are equal modulo $2\cdot\pi$.
Therefore, 
\[
\begin{aligned}
\GB(\Delta)&=\tgc{\partial\Delta}_\Sigma+\area[\Norm(\Delta)]-2\cdot \pi=
2\cdot n \cdot \pi
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:sum=2pin}\]
for an integer~$n$.

It remains to show that $n=0$.
By \ref{prop:total-signed-curvature}, this is so for a topological disc in a plane.
One can think of a general disc $\Delta$ as the result of a continuous deformation of a plane disc.
The integer $n$ cannot change in the process of deformation since the left-hand side in \ref{eq:sum=2pin} is continuous along the deformation; 
whence $n=0$ for the result of the deformation.

\section{Simple geodesic}

The following theorem provides an interesting application of the Gauss--Bonnet formula; it is proved by Stephan Cohn-Vossen \cite[Satz 9 in][]{convossen}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:cohn-vossen}
Any open smooth surface with positive Gauss curvature has a simple two-sided infinite geodesic.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\Sigma$ be an open surface with positive Gauss curvature and $\gamma$ a two-sided infinite geodesic in~$\Sigma$.

If $\gamma$ has a self-intersection, then it contains a simple loop;
that is, for some closed interval $[a,b]$,
the restriction $\ell=\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ is a simple loop.

By \ref{ex:convex-proper-plane}, $\Sigma$ is parametrized by an open convex region $\Omega$ in the plane.
By Jordan's theorem (\ref{thm:jordan}), $\ell$ bounds a disc in $\Sigma$; denote it by~$\Delta$.
If $\phi$ is the angle at the base of the loop, then by the Gauss--Bonnet formula,
\[\iint_\Delta K=\pi+\phi.\] 

Recall that by \ref{ex:intK:2pi}, we have
\[\iint_\Sigma K\le 2\cdot\pi.\eqlbl{intK=<2pi+}\]
Therefore, $0<\phi<\pi$; that is, $\gamma$ has no concave simple loops.

Assume $\gamma$ has two simple loops, say $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ that bound discs $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$, respectively.
Then the discs $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ have to overlap;
otherwise, the curvature of $\Sigma$ would exceed $2\cdot\pi$  contradicting \ref{intK=<2pi+}.


It follows that after leaving $\Delta_1$, the geodesic $\gamma$ has to enter it again before creating another simple loop.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-1550}
\end{figure}
Consider the moment when $\gamma$ enters $\Delta_1$ again;
two possible scenarios are shown in the picture.
On the left picture, we get two nonoverlapping discs which, as we know, is impossible.
The right picture is impossible as well --- in this case, we get a concave simple loop.

It follows that $\gamma$ contains only one simple loop.
This loop cuts a disc from $\Sigma$ 
and goes around it either clockwise or counterclockwise.
This way we divide all the self-intersecting geodesics on $\Sigma$
into two sets which we call {}\emph{clockwise} and {}\emph{counterclockwise}.

Note that the geodesic $t\mapsto \gamma(t)$ is clockwise 
if and only if the same geodesic traveled backwards
$t\mapsto \gamma(-t)$
is counterclockwise.

Let us shoot a unit-speed geodesic in each direction from a given point $p\z=\gamma(0)$.
This gives a one-parameter family of geodesics $\gamma_s$ for $s\in[0,\pi]$ connecting the geodesic $t\mapsto \gamma(t)$ with $t\mapsto \gamma(-t)$; that is, $\gamma_0(t)\z=\gamma(t)$, and $\gamma_\pi(t)=\gamma(-t)$.

Observe that the subset of values $s\in [0,\pi]$ such that $\gamma_s$ is right (or left) is open.
That is, if $\gamma_s$ is right, then so is $\gamma_t$ for all $t$ sufficiently close to~$s$.
Indeed, denote by $\phi_s$ the angle of the simple loop of $\gamma_s$.
From above, we have $0<\phi_s<\pi$.
Therefore, the self-intersection at the base of the loop of $\gamma_s$ is transverse.
Since geodesic depends smoothly on the initial data 
(\ref{prop:geod-existence}), the self-intersection survives in $\gamma_t$ for all $t$ sufficiently close to~$s$.

Since $[0,\pi]$ is connected, it cannot be subdivided into two nonempty open sets.
It follows that for some $s$, the geodesic $\gamma_s$ is neither  clockwise nor counterclockwise;
that is, $\gamma_s$ has no self-intersections.

Suppose $\alpha\:[0,1]\z\to \Sigma$ is a smooth loop such that $\alpha'(0)+\alpha'(1)=0$.

\end{thm}

\section{General domains}
\index{Gauss--Bonnet formula}

The following generalization of the Gauss--Bonnet formula is due to Walther von Dyck \cite{dyck}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:GB-generalized}
Let $\Lambda$ be a compact domain on a smooth surface.
Assume $\Lambda$ is bounded by a finite (possibly empty) collection of simple closed piecewise smooth curves $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n$.
Suppose that each $\gamma_i$ 
is oriented in such a way that $\Lambda$ lies on its left.
Then
\[\iint_\Lambda K=2\cdot \pi\cdot \chi-\tgc{\gamma_1}-\dots-\tgc{\gamma_n}\eqlbl{eq:g-b++}\]
for an integer $\chi=\chi(\Lambda)$.

Moreover, if $\Lambda$ can be subdivided into $f$ discs ($f$ stands for faces) by an embedded graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges, then $\chi=v-e+f$.
\end{thm}

The number $\chi=\chi(\Lambda)$ is called the \index{Euler characteristic}\emph{Euler characteristic} of $\Lambda$. 
Note that $\chi$ does not depend on the choice of the subdivision since the remaining terms in \ref{eq:g-b++} do not.
Formula \ref{eq:g-b++} is deduced from the standard Gauss--Bonnet (\ref{thm:gb}).
The argument is similar to \ref{lem:GB-sum}, but the combinatorics gets trickier.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{38 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-1580}
\end{wrapfigure}

Before reading the proof, try to modify the argument in \ref{lem:GB-sum} to derive the formula for the subdivision of the annulus $A$ on the diagram;
its graph has 4 vertices and 6 edges (one of them is a loop) and it subdivides $A$ into two discs $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$.
Therefore, we have $\chi(A)=4-6+2=0$ and we should get 
\[\iint_A K=-\tgc{\gamma_1}-\tgc{\gamma_2}.\]


\parit{Proof.}
Suppose that a graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges subdivides $\Lambda$ into $f$ discs $\Delta_1,\dots,\Delta_f$.
Lets us apply the Gauss--Bonnet formula for each disc, and sum up the results:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\iint_\Lambda K&=\iint_{\Delta_1} K+\dots+\iint_{\Delta_f} K=
\\
&=2\cdot f\cdot \pi-\tgc{\partial\Delta_1}-\dots-\tgc{\partial\Delta_f}.
\end{aligned}
\]
It remains to show that  
\[\tgc{\gamma_1}+\dots+\tgc{\gamma_n}-\tgc{\partial\Delta_1}-\dots-\tgc{\partial\Delta_f}
=
2\cdot\pi\cdot(v-e).
\eqlbl{eq:GB-sum}\]
To prove this identity, we compute the left-hand side adding up the contributions of each edge and each vertex separately.

Choose an edge $\sigma$ of the graph.
If $\sigma$ is not part of some $\gamma_i$,
then it appears twice in the boundary of the discs, say in  $\partial \Delta_i$ and $ \partial \Delta_j$. 
In the latter case, we may assume that $\Delta_i$ lies on the left from $\sigma$ and $\Delta_j$ is on its right, so 
 $\sigma$ contributes $\tgc\sigma$ to $\tgc{\partial\Delta_i}$ and $-\tgc\sigma$ to $\tgc{\partial\Delta_j}$; hence $\sigma$ contributes nothing to the left-hand side of \ref{eq:GB-sum}.
It might happen that $i=j$ (as for one of the edges on the diagram above);
in this case, we have one disc on both sides of~$\sigma$, but still, it contributes nothing to \ref{eq:GB-sum}.
If $\sigma$ is part of some $\gamma_i$, then it also appears once in the boundary of some disc, say in $\partial \Delta_j$.
We may assume that both $\Lambda$ and $\Delta_j$ lie on the left from $\sigma$,
so it contributes $\tgc\sigma$ to both $\tgc{\gamma_i}$ and $\tgc{\partial\Delta_j}$.
These contributions cancel each other on the left-hand side of  \ref{eq:GB-sum}.

Summarizing, the contributions to the left-hand side of  \ref{eq:GB-sum} that come from the total geodesic curvatures of edges cancel out.

Let us now handle the external angles at the vertices.
Choose a vertex $p$.
Denote by $d$ the \index{degree of vertex}\emph{degree} of~$p$;
that is, the number of edges that end at~$p$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{23 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-1585}
\end{wrapfigure}

Suppose $p$ lies in the interior of $\Lambda$.
Denote by $\delta_1,\dots,\delta_d$ the internal angles at $p$ of the discs containing $p$ as a vertex. 
Let  $\phi_{i}=\pi-\delta_{i}$ be the corresponding external angles.
Then $p$ contributes  
$-\phi_1-\dots-\phi_d$ to the sum.
Note that $\delta_1+\dots+\delta_d=2\cdot\pi$;
so $p$ contributes
\[-\phi_1-\dots-\phi_d = (\delta_1+\dots+\delta_d) - d\cdot \pi=(2-d)\cdot \pi,\]
to the left-hand side of \ref{eq:GB-sum}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{23 mm}
\vskip-6mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-1590}
\end{wrapfigure}

If $p$ lies on the boundary of $\Lambda$, then it is a vertex of $d-1$ internal angles
$\delta_1,\dots,\delta_{d-1}$.
Let $\phi_{i}\z=\pi-\delta_{i}$ be the corresponding external angles.
Note that
\[\delta_1+\dots+\delta_{d-1}\z=\pi-\theta,\]
where $\theta\in(-\pi,\pi)$ denotes the external angle of $\Lambda$ at $p$.
And again, $p$ contributes
\[\theta-\sum\phi_{i}=(2-d)\cdot \pi\]
to the left-hand side of \ref{eq:GB-sum}.

Summarizing, suppose $p_1,\dots,p_v$ are the vertices of the graph, and $d_1,\dots,d_v$ are their corresponding degrees.
Then the total contribution from external angles to the left-hand side of  \ref{eq:GB-sum} is 
\[2\cdot v\cdot \pi-(d_1+\dots+d_v)\cdot\pi.
\eqlbl{eq:GB-sum-d}\]
Since the edges contributed nothing, the left-hand side of  \ref{eq:GB-sum} equals \ref{eq:GB-sum-d}.

It remains to observe that $d_1+\dots+d_v=2\cdot e$.
Indeed, $d_1+\dots+d_v$ is the total number of ends of $e$ edges in the graph, and each edge has exactly two ends. 
This finishes the proof of \ref{eq:GB-sum} and \ref{eq:g-b++}.
