\chapter{Afterword}

For further study, you need to read a text on tensor calculus;
the book by Richard Bishop and Samuel Goldberg \cite{bishop-goldberg} is one of our favorites.
Once it is done, you are ready for Riemannian geometry.
You might be surprised to see that half of the material in this subject looks familiar.

Let us list a few introductory texts we know and love that range from very detailed to very condensed and challenging:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Riemannian manifolds''  \cite{lee2006riemannian} by John Lee.
\item ``Riemannian geometry'' \cite{carmo1992riemannian} by Manfredo do Carmo.
\item ``Riemannsche Geometrie im Gro√üen'' \cite{gromoll-klingenberg-meyer} by 
Detlef Gromoll,
Wilhelm Klingenberg, 
and  Werner Meyer;
it is in German, plus there is a Russian translation \cite{gromoll-klingenberg-meyer-ru}.
In Russian, there is a more elementary textbook by Yurii Burago and Viktor Zalgaller \cite{burago-zalgaller}.
\item ``Comparison geometry'' \cite{cheeger-ebin} by Jeff Cheeger and David Ebin. 
\item ``Sign and geometric meaning of curvature'' \cite{gromov-1991} by Mikhael Gromov.
\end{itemize}
Good luck.
