For further study, you need to read a text on tensor calculus; the book of Richard Bishop and Samuel Goldberg \cite{bishop-goldberg} is one of our favorites.
Once it is done, you are ready to do Riemannian geometry.

You may go with  ``Comparison geometry'' \cite{cheeger-ebin} --- the good old classics from Jeff Cheeger and David Ebin. 
In this case you might be surprised to see that you already know half of material in the book;
altho it is only written using a different language.
For example proofs of the comparisons theorem require only cosmetic modifications.

A safer option would be another classical book ``Riemannsche Geometrie im Gro√üen'' \cite{gromoll-klingenberg-meyer} by 
Detlef Gromoll,
Wilhelm Klingenberg, 
and  Werner Meyer (it is available in German and Russian).

Mikhael Gromov's ``Sign and geometric meaning of curvature'' \cite{gromov-1991} is more challenging, but worth trying. 

Good luck.
