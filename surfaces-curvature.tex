\section{Tangent-normal coordinates} \label{sec:lmn}
\index{tangent-normal coordinates}

Fix a point $p$ in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$.
Consider a coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ with origin at $p$ such that the $(x,y)$-plane coincides with $\T_p$ and the $z$-axis points in the direction of the normal vector $\Norm(p)$.
By \ref{ex:vertical-tangent}, we can present $\Sigma$ locally at $p$ as a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function. 
Note that 
\begin{align*}
f(0,0)&=0,
&
f_x(0,0)&=0,
&
f_y(0,0)&=0.
\end{align*}
The first equality holds since $p=(0,0,0)$ lies on the graph and the other two equalities mean that the tangent plane at $p$ is horizontal.

Set 
\begin{align*}
\ell&=f_{xx}(0,0),
\\
m&=f_{xy}(0,0)=f_{yx}(0,0),
\\
n&=f_{yy}(0,0).
\end{align*}
The {}\emph{Taylor series} 
for $f$ at $(0,0)$ up to the second order term can be then written as
\[f(x,y)=\tfrac12(\ell\cdot x^2+2\cdot m\cdot x\cdot y+n\cdot y^2)+o(x^2+y^2).\]
Note that values $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ are completely determined by this equation.\index{10lmn@$\ell$, $m$, $n$}
The so-called \index{osculating!paraboloid}\emph{osculating paraboloid}
\[z=\tfrac12\cdot(\ell\cdot x^2+2\cdot m\cdot x\cdot y+n\cdot y^2)\]
has \index{order of contact}\emph{second order of contact} with $\Sigma$ at $p$.

Note that 
\[\ell\cdot x^2+2\cdot m\cdot x\cdot y+n\cdot y^2=\langle M_p\cdot (\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\y
\end{smallmatrix}), (\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\y
\end{smallmatrix})\rangle,\]
where $M_p$ is the so-called \index{Hessian matrix}\emph{Hessian matrix} of $f$ at $(0,0)$,\index{10m@$M_p$}
\[M_p=\begin{pmatrix}
 \ell
 &m
 \\
 m
 &n
 \end{pmatrix}.
\eqlbl{eq:hessian}
\]


\section{Principal curvatures}

Note that tangent-normal coordinates give an almost canonical coordinate system in a neighborhood of $p$;
it is unique up to a rotation of the $(x,y)$-plane.
Rotating the $(x,y)$-plane results in rewriting 
the matrix $M_p$ in the new basis.

Since the Hessian matrix $M_p$ is symmetric, by the spectral theorem (\ref{thm:spectral}) it is diagonalizable by orthogonal matrices.
That is, by rotating the $(x,y)$-plane we can assume that $m=0$ in \ref{eq:hessian}; see \ref{thm:spectral}.
In this case
\[M_p=\begin{pmatrix}
 k_1
 &0
 \\
 0
 &k_2
 \end{pmatrix},
\]
the diagonal components $k_1$ and $k_2$ of $M_p$ are called the \index{principal curvatures and directions}\emph{principal curvatures} of $\Sigma$ at $p$;\index{10k@$k_1$, $k_2$}
they might also be denoted as $k_1(p)$ and $k_2(p)$, or $k_1(p)_\Sigma$ and $k_2(p)_\Sigma$;
if we need to emphasize that we compute them at the point $p$ for the surface $\Sigma$.
We will always assume that $k_1\le k_2$.


Note that if $x=f(x,y)$ is a local graph representation of $\Sigma$ in these coordinates, then 
\[f(x,y)=\tfrac12\cdot(k_1\cdot x^2+k_2\cdot y^2)+o(x^2+y^2).\]

The principal curvatures can be also defined as the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix $M_p$.
The eigendirections of $M_p$ are called the {}\emph{principal directions} of $\Sigma$ at~$p$.
Note that if $k_1(p)\ne k_2(p)$, then $p$ has exactly two principal directions, which are perpendicular to each other; if $k_1(p)\z= k_2(p)$ then all tangent directions at $p$ are principal.

Note that if we revert the orientation of $\Sigma$, then the principal curvatures switch their signs and indexes.

A smooth regular curve on a surface $\Sigma$ that always runs in the principal directions is called a \index{line of curvature}\emph{line of curvature} of $\Sigma$. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:line-of-curvature}
Assume that a smooth surface $\Sigma$ is mirror symmetric with respect to a plane $\Pi$.
Suppose that $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ intersect along a smooth regular curve~$\gamma$.
Show that $\gamma$ is a line of curvature of $\Sigma$.
\end{thm}

\section{More curvatures}\label{sec:More curvatures}

Let $p$ be a point on an oriented smooth surface $\Sigma$.

The product 
\[K(p)=k_1(p)\cdot k_2(p)\]
is called the \index{10k@$K$}\index{Gauss curvature}\emph{Gauss curvature} at $p$.
We may denote it by $K$, $K(p)$, or $K(p)_\Sigma$ if we need to specify the point $p$ and the surface $\Sigma$.

Since the determinant is equal to the product of the eigenvalues, we get
\[K=\ell\cdot n-m^2,\]
where 
$M_p\z=
(\begin{smallmatrix}
\ell&m
\\
m&n
\end{smallmatrix}
)
$ is the Hessian matrix.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:gauss+orientable}
Show that any surface with positive Gauss curvature is orientable. 
\end{thm}

The sum \index{10h@$H$}
\[H(p)=k_1(p)+ k_2(p)\] 
is called the \index{curvature}\index{mean curvature}\emph{mean curvature}\footnote{Some authors define the mean curvature as $\tfrac12\cdot(k_1(p)+ k_2(p))$ --- the mean value of the principal curvatures. It suits the name better, but it is not as convenient when it comes to calculations.} at $p$.
We may also denote it by $H(p)_\Sigma$.
The mean curvature can be also interpreted as the trace of the Hessian matrix $M_p\z=
(\begin{smallmatrix}
\ell&m
\\
m&n
\end{smallmatrix}
)$;
that is,
\[H=\ell+n\] 

A surface with vanishing mean curvature is called \index{minimal surface}\emph{minimal}.

Note that reverting the orientation of $\Sigma$ does not change the Gauss curvature, but changes the sign of the mean curvature.
In particular, the Gauss curvature is well defined for a nonoriented surfaces.

\section{Shape operator}

In the following definitions we use the notion of directional derivative defined in \ref{def:directional-derivative}.

Let $p$ be a point on a smooth surface $\Sigma$ with orientation defined by the unit normal field $\Norm$.
Given $\vec w\in \T_p$,
its \index{shape operator}\emph{shape operator} is defined by
\[\Shape_p\vec w=-D_{\vec w}\Norm.\]
Equivalently, the shape operator can be defined by
\[\Shape=-d\Norm,\eqlbl{eq:shape=-L}\] 
where $d\Norm$ denotes the differential of the spherical map $\Norm\:\Sigma\to\mathbb{S}^2$; that is, $d_p\Norm(\vec v)=(D_{\vec v}\Norm)(p)$.

Recall that $d_p\Norm$ is a linear map $\T_p\Sigma\to \T_{\Norm(p)}\mathbb{S}^2$.
Note that $\T_p\Sigma$ coincides with $\T_{\Norm(p)}\mathbb{S}^2$ --- both of them are normal subspaces to $\Norm(p)$.
Therefore $\Shape_p$ is indeed a linear operator $\T_p\to \T_p$ (the latter also follows from \ref{thm:shape-chart}).

For a point $p\in \Sigma$ the shape operator of a tangent vector $\vec w\in \T_p$ will be denoted by $\Shape\vec w$ if it is clear from the context which base point $p$ and which surface we are working with;
otherwise we may use the notations 
\[\Shape_p(\vec w)\quad\text{or}\quad \Shape_p(\vec w)_\Sigma\]
as the situation requires.
\footnote{
The following bilinear forms on a tangent plane  
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{I}(\vec v,\vec w)&=\langle\vec v,\vec w\rangle,
&
\mathrm{II}(\vec v,\vec w)&=\langle\Shape\vec v,\vec w\rangle,
&
\mathrm{III}(\vec v,\vec w)&=\langle\Shape\vec v,\Shape\vec w\rangle
\end{align*}
are called the \index{fundamental form}\emph{first, second, and third fundamental forms} respectively.
These forms were introduced before the shape operator, but we will not touch them in the sequel.
}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:shape-chart}
Suppose that $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ is a smooth map to a smooth surface $\Sigma$ with unit normal field $\Norm$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
\langle \Shape(s_u), s_u\rangle 
&=\langle s_{uu},\Norm\rangle,
&
\langle \Shape(s_v), s_u\rangle 
&=\langle s_{uv},\Norm\rangle,
\\
\langle \Shape(s_u), s_v\rangle 
&=\langle s_{uv},\Norm\rangle,
&
\langle \Shape(s_v), s_v\rangle 
&=\langle s_{vv},\Norm\rangle,
\\
\langle \Shape(s_u), \Norm\rangle 
&=0,
&
\langle \Shape(s_v), \Norm\rangle 
&=0
\end{align*}
for any $(u,v)$.

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We will use the shortcut $\Norm=\Norm(u,v)$ for $\Norm(s(u,v))$,
so 
\[
\begin{aligned}
\Shape(s_u)&=-D_{s_u}\Norm=-\Norm_u,
&
\Shape(s_v)&=-D_{s_v}\Norm=-\Norm_v.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:shape=norm_u}
\]

Note that $\Norm$ is a unit vector orthogonal to $s_u$ and $s_v$;
therefore
\begin{align*}
\langle \Norm,s_u\rangle&\equiv0,
&
\langle \Norm,s_v\rangle&\equiv0,
&
\langle \Norm,\Norm\rangle&\equiv1.
\end{align*}
Taking partial derivatives of these two identities we get
\begin{align*}
\langle \Norm_u,s_u\rangle+\langle \Norm,s_{uu}\rangle&=0,
&
\langle \Norm_v,s_u\rangle+\langle \Norm,s_{uv}\rangle&=0,
\\
\langle \Norm_u,s_v\rangle+\langle \Norm,s_{uv}\rangle&=0,
&
\langle \Norm_v,s_v\rangle+\langle \Norm,s_{vv}\rangle&=0,
\\
2\cdot\langle \Norm_u,\Norm\rangle&=0,
&
2\cdot\langle \Norm_v,\Norm\rangle&=0.
\end{align*}
It remains to plug in the expressions from \ref{eq:shape=norm_u}.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:self-adjoint}
Show that the shape operator is \index{self-adjoint operator}\emph{self-adjoint}; that is,
\[\langle \Shape\vec u,\vec v\rangle=\langle \vec u,\Shape\vec v\rangle\]
for any $\vec u,\vec v\in\T_p$.
\end{thm}

Let us denote by $\vec i$, $\vec j$ and $\vec k$ the standard basis in the $\mathbb{R}^3$.\index{10i@$\vec i$, $\vec j$, $\vec k$}
Recall that the components $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ of the Hessian matrix are defined in Section~\ref{sec:lmn}.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:Shape(ij)}
Let $z=f(x,y)$ be a local representation of a smooth surface $\Sigma$ in the tangent-normal coordinates at $p$.
Suppose that its the Hessian matrix at $p$ is $(\begin{smallmatrix}
\ell&m\\ m&n
\end{smallmatrix})$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
\Shape\vec i&=\ell\cdot \vec i+m\cdot \vec j,
&
\Shape\vec j&=m\cdot \vec i+n\cdot\vec j;
\end{align*}
that is, the multiplication by the Hessian matrix at $p$ describes its shape operator.

In particular, the principal curvatures of $\Sigma$ at $p$ are the eigenvalues of $\Shape_p$ and the principal directions are the eigendirections of $\Shape_p$.
\end{thm}

Since the Hessian matrix is symmetric, the corollary also implies that $\Shape$ is self-adjoint which gives another way to solve \ref{ex:self-adjoint}.

\parit{Proof.}
Note that $s\:(u,v)\mapsto (u,v,f(u,v))$ is a chart of $\Sigma$ that covers $p$.
Further note that 
\begin{align*}
s_u(0,0)&=\vec i,
&
s_v(0,0)&=\vec j,
&
\Norm(0,0)&=\vec k,
\\
s_{uu}(0,0)&=\ell\cdot \vec k,
&
s_{uv}(0,0)&=m\cdot \vec k,
&
s_{vv}(0,0)&=n\cdot \vec k.
\end{align*}
It remains to apply \ref{thm:shape-chart}.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:intK}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface with orientation defined by a unit normal field $\Norm$.
Suppose the spherical map $\Norm\:\Sigma\to\mathbb{S}^2$ is injective.
Then 
\[\iint_\Sigma|K|=\area[\Norm(\Sigma)].\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Observe that the tangent planes $\T_p\Sigma=\T_{\Norm(p)}\mathbb{S}^2$ are parallel for any $p\in\Sigma$.
Indeed both of these planes are perpendicular to $\Norm(p)$. 


Choose an orthonormal basis of $\T_p$ consisting of principal directions,
so the shape operator can be expressed by the matrix 
$(\begin{smallmatrix}
 k_1
 &0
 \\
 0
 &k_2
 \end{smallmatrix})$.

Since $\Shape_p=-d_p\Norm$, \ref{cor:Shape(ij)} implies that
\[\jac_p\Norm=|\det(\begin{smallmatrix}
 k_1
 &0
 \\
 0
 &k_2
 \end{smallmatrix})|=|K(p)|.\]
By the area formula (\ref{prop:surface-integral}), the statement follows.

We define the {}\emph{angle} between two oriented surfaces at a point of their intersection $p$ as the angle between their normal vectors at $p$.

\section{Curves in a surface}\label{sec:Darboux}

\end{wrapfigure}

Suppose $\gamma$ is a regular smooth curve in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$.
As usual we denote by $\Norm$ the unit normal field on~$\Sigma$.

Without loss of generality we may assume that $\gamma$ is unit-speed;
in this case $\tan(s)=\gamma'(s)$ is its tangent indicatrix.
Let us use the shortcut notation $\Norm(s)\z=\Norm(\gamma(s))$.
Note that the unit vectors $\tan(s)$ and $\Norm(s)$ are orthogonal.
Тherefore there is a unique unit vector $\mu(s)$\index{10tmn@$\tan$, $\mu$, $\Norm$} such that 
$\tan(s),\mu(s),\Norm(s)$ is an oriented orthonormal basis;
it is called the \index{Darboux frame}\emph{Darboux frame} of $\gamma$ in $\Sigma$.
Since $\T_{\gamma (s)}\z\perp\Norm(s)$, the vector $\mu(s)$ is tangent to $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(s)$.
In fact $\mu(s)$ is a counterclockwise rotation of $\tan(s)$ by the angle $\tfrac\pi2$ in the tangent plane $\T_{\gamma(s)}$.
This vector can also be defined as the vector product $\mu(s)=\Norm(s)\times \tan(s)$.

Since $\gamma$ is unit-speed, we have that $\gamma''\perp \gamma'$ (see \ref{prop:a'-pertp-a''}).
Therefore the acceleration of $\gamma$ can be written as a linear combination of $\mu$ and $\Norm$;
that is,
\[\gamma''(s)=k_g(s)\cdot \mu(s)+k_n(s)\cdot\Norm(s).\]\index{10k@$k_g$, $k_n$}
The values $k_g(s)$ and $k_n(s)$ are called \index{curvature}\index{geodesic!curvature}\emph{geodesic} and \index{normal!curvature}\emph{normal curvatures} of $\gamma$ at $s$, respectively.
Since the frame $\tan(s),\mu(s),\Norm(s)$ is orthonormal, these curvatures can be also written as the following scalar products:
\begin{align*}
k_g(s)&=\langle \gamma''(s),\mu(s)\rangle
=
\\
&=\langle \tan'(s),\mu(s)\rangle.
\\
k_n(s)&=\langle \gamma''(s),\Norm(s)\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \tan'(s),\Norm(s)\rangle.
\end{align*}

Since $0=\langle \tan(s),\Norm(s)\rangle$ we have 
that 
\begin{align*}
0&=\langle \tan(s),\Norm(s)\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \tan'(s),\Norm(s)\rangle+\langle \tan(s),\Norm'(s)\rangle=
\\
&=k_n(s)+\langle \tan(s),D_{\tan(s)}\Norm\rangle.
\end{align*}
Applying the definition of shape operator,
we get the following:

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:normal-shape}
Assume $\gamma$ is a smooth unit-speed curve in a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Let $p=\gamma(s_0)$ and $\vec v=\gamma'(s_0)$.
Then 
\[k_n(s_0)=\langle \Shape_p(\vec v),\vec v\rangle,\]
where $k_n$ denotes the normal curvature of $\gamma$ at $s_0$ and $\Shape_p$ is the shape operator at $p$.
\end{thm}

Note that according to the proposition, the normal curvature of a regular smooth curve in $\Sigma$ is completely determined by the velocity vector $\vec v$ at the point $p$.
By that reason the normal curvature is also denoted by $k_{\vec v}$;\index{10k@$k_{\vec v}$}
according to the proposition,
\[k_{\vec v}=\langle \Shape_p(\vec v),\vec v\rangle\]
for any unit vector $\vec v$ in $\T_p$.

Let $p$ be a point on a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Assume we choose tangent-normal coordinates at $p$ so that the Hessian matrix is diagonalized, then we have
\[M_p=\begin{pmatrix}
 k_1(p)
 &0
 \\
 0
 &k_2(p)
 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Consider a vector ${\vec w}=a\cdot\vec i+b\cdot\vec j$ in the $(x,y)$-plane.
Then by \ref{cor:Shape(ij)}, we have
\[
\langle \Shape\vec w,\vec w\rangle
=a^2\cdot k_1(p) +b^2\cdot k_2(p). 
\]
If ${\vec w}$ is unit, then $a^2+b^2=1$ which implies the following:

\begin{thm}{Observation}\label{obs:k1-k2}
For any point $p$ on an oriented smooth surface $\Sigma$,
the principal curvatures $k_1(p)$ and $k_2(p)$ are respectively the minimum and maximum of the normal curvatures at $p$.
Moreover, if $\theta$ is the angle between a unit vector ${\vec w}\in\T_p$ and the first principal direction at $p$, then 
\[k_{\vec w}(p)=k_1(p)\cdot(\cos\theta)^2+k_2(p)\cdot(\sin\theta)^2.\]

\end{thm}

The last identity is called \index{Euler's formula}\emph{Euler's formula}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:mean-curvature}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface.
Show that the sum of the normal curvatures for any pair of orthogonal directions, at a point $p\in\Sigma$ equals $H(p)$ --- the mean curvature at $p$. 
\end{thm}




\begin{thm}{Meusnier's theorem}
\label{thm:meusnier}
\index{Meusnier's theorem}
Let $\gamma$ be a regular smooth curve that runs along a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$.
Let $p=\gamma(t_0)$, ${\vec v}\z=\gamma'(t_0)$, and $\alpha\z=\measuredangle(\Norm(p),\norm(t_0))$;
that is, $\alpha$ is the angle between the unit normal to $\Sigma$ at $p$ and the unit normal vector in the Frenet frame of $\gamma$ at~$t_0$.
Then the following identity holds true 
\[\kur(t_0)\cdot\cos\alpha=k_{n}(t_0);\]
here $\kur(t_0)$ and $k_n(t_0)$ are the curvature and the normal curvature of $\gamma$ at $t_0$, respectively. 
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.} Since $\gamma''=\tan'=\kur\cdot \norm$, we get that
\begin{align*}
k_{n}(t_0)&=\langle\gamma'',\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=\kur(t_0)\cdot\langle\norm,\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=\kur(t_0)\cdot\cos\alpha.
\end{align*}

The theorem above, as well as the statement in the following exercise were proved by Jean Baptiste Meusnier \cite{meusnier}.

Show that the osculating circles at $p$ of smooth regular curves in $\Sigma$ that run in the direction ${\vec v}$ sweep out a sphere $S$ with center $p+\tfrac1{k_{\vec v}}\cdot\Norm$ and radius $r=\tfrac1{|k_{\vec v}|}$.

\section{Lagunov's example}
\index{Lagunov's example}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:moon-revolution}
Assume $V$ is a body in $\mathbb{R}^3$ bounded by a smooth surface of revolution with principal curvatures at most 1 in absolute value.
Show that $V$ contains a unit ball.
\end{thm}

The following question is a 3-dimensional analog of the moon in a puddle problem (\ref{thm:moon}).

\begin{thm}{Question}\label{quest:lagunov}
Assume a set $V\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is bounded by a closed connected surface $\Sigma$ with 
principal curvatures bounded in absolute value by 1.
Is it true that $V$ contains a ball of radius 1?
\end{thm}

According to \ref{ex:moon-revolution}, the answer is ``yes'' for surfaces of revolution.
Later (see \ref{ex:convex-lagunov})
we will show that the answer is ``yes'' for convex surfaces.
Now we are going to show by an example that the answer is ``no'' in the general case;
this example was constructed by Vladimir Lagunov \cite{lagunov-1961}.


\parit{Construction.}
Let us start with a body of revolution $V_1$ whose cross section is shown on the diagram below.
The boundary curve of the cross section consists of 6 long vertical line segments included into 3 closed simple smooth curves.
(To make the curves smooth, one has to use cutoffs and mollifiers from Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.)
The boundary of $V_1$ has 3 components, each of which is a smooth sphere.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{20 mm}
\vskip-6mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-910}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

We assume that the curves have curvature at most~1.
Moreover with the exception of the almost vertical parts, the curve has absolute curvature close to 1 all the time.
The only thick part in $V$ is the place where all three boundary components come close together;
the remaining part of $V$ is assumed to be very thin.
It could be arranged that the radius $r$ of the maximal ball in $V$ is just a little bit above 
$r_2=\tfrac2{\sqrt{3}}-1$.
(The small black disc on the diagram has radius $r_2$,
assuming that the three big circles are unit.)
In particular, we may assume that $r<\tfrac16$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-33}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Exercise \ref{ex:principal-revolution} gives formulas for the principal curvatures of the boundary of $V$;
which imply that both principal curvatures are at most 1 in absolute value. 

It remains to modify $V_1$ to make its boundary connected without increasing the bounds on its principal curvatures and without allowing larger balls inside.

Note that each sphere in the boundary contains two flat discs;
they come into pairs closely lying to each other. 
Let us drill thru two of such pairs and reconnect the holes by another body of revolution whose 
axis is shifted but stays parallel to the axis of $V_1$.
Denote the obtained body by $V_2$; the cross section of the obtained body is shown on the diagram. 

Then repeat the operation for the other two pairs.
Denote the obtained body by $V_3$.

Note that the boundary of $V_3$ is connected.
Assuming that the holes are large, its boundary can be made so that its principal curvatures are still at most $1$; the latter can be proved in the same way as for~$V_1$.

\section*{Remarks}

Note that the surface of $V_3$ in the Lagunov's example has genus 2;
that is, it can be parametrized by a sphere with two handles.

Indeed, the boundary of $V_1$ consists of three smooth spheres.

When we drill a hole, we make one hole in two spheres and two holes in one sphere.
We reconnect two spheres with a tube and obtain one sphere.
By connecting the two holes of the other sphere with a tube we get a torus;
it is on the right side in the picture of $V_2$.
That is, the boundary of $V_2$ is formed by one sphere and one torus.

To construct $V_3$ from $V_2$, we make a torus from the remaining sphere and connect it to the other torus by a tube.
This way we get a sphere with two handles; that is, it has genus 2.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:lagunov-genus4}
Modify Lagunov's construction to make the boundary surface a sphere with 4 handles.
\end{thm}

Question \ref{quest:lagunov} can be asked differently: what is the maximal radius $r$ of the ball that has to be included in any body bounded by a smooth surface with principal curvatures bounded in absolute value by 1.

One may also consider bodies bounded by more than one smooth surface.
In this case the example of a region between two large concentric spheres with almost equal radii shows that in the general case there is no bound.
Indeed, this region can be made arbitrarily thin while the curvature of the boundary can be made arbitrarily close to zero.

Recall that the Lagunov example shows that $r\le r_2$,
where $r_2$ is the radius of the smallest circle tangent to three unit circles that are tangent to each other,
so 
\[r_2=\tfrac2{\sqrt{3}}-1< \tfrac16.\]
The statement in the following exercise is due to Vladimir Lagunov \cite{lagunov-1960};
it implies that this bound is optimal.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:thin}
Suppose a connected body $V\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is bounded by a finite number of closed smooth surfaces with principal curvatures bounded in absolute value by 1.
Assume that $V$ does not contain a ball of radius $r_2$.
Show that its boundary has two diffeomorphic connected components. 
\end{thm}


Let $r_3$
be the radius of the smallest sphere tangent to four unit spheres that are tangent to each other.
Direct calculations show that 
\[r_3=\sqrt{\tfrac32}-1>\tfrac15.\]
In particular $r_3>r_2$.

The statement in the following exercise is a special case of a theorem by Vladimir Lagunov and Abram Fet \cite{lagunov-fet-1963, lagunov-fet-1965}.

\begin{thm}{Very advanced exercise}\label{ex:PI-sphere}
Suppose a body $V\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is bounded by a smooth sphere with principal curvatures bounded in absolute value by 1.
Show that $V$ contains a ball of radius~$r_3$.

Show that this bound is sharp; that is, show that for every $\epsilon >0$, there are examples of $V$ as above not containing a ball of radius $r_3+\epsilon$.
\end{thm}
